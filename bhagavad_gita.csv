Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra said: O Sa√±jaya, after my sons and the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu assembled in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruk·π£etra, desiring to fight, what did they do?","Purport
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is the widely read theistic science summarized in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ-mƒÅhƒÅtmya
(
Glorification of the Gƒ´tƒÅ
). There it says that one should read
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
directly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa.
The topics discussed by Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra and Sa√±jaya, as described in the
MahƒÅbhƒÅrata,
form the basic principle for this great philosophy. It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age. It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.
The word
dharma-k·π£etra
(a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna. Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons‚Äô ultimate victory. In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sa√±jaya, ‚ÄúWhat did they do?‚Äù He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother PƒÅ·πá·∏çu were assembled in that Field of Kuruk·π£etra for a determined engagement of the war. Still, his inquiry is significant. He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk·π£etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the
Vedas
as a place of worship ‚Äì even for the denizens of heaven ‚Äì Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa√±jaya was a student of VyƒÅsa, and therefore, by the mercy of VyƒÅsa, Sa√±jaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra even while he was in the room of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra. And so, Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.
Both the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas and the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra belong to the same family, but Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra‚Äôs mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk·π£etra, where the father of religion, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra‚Äôs son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi·π£·π≠hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words
dharma-k·π£etre
and
kuru-k·π£etre,
apart from their historical and Vedic importance."

Sa√±jaya said: O King, after looking over the army arranged in military formation by the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and spoke the following words.","Purport
Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra was blind from birth. Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual vision. He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Sa√±jaya could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield. Sa√±jaya wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assured him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place. Sa√±jaya therefore informed the king that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, at once went to the commander in chief, Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya, to inform him of the real position. Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. But Duryodhana‚Äôs diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas."

O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple the son of Drupada.","Purport
Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya, the great
brƒÅhma·πáa
commander in chief. Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupadƒ´, who was Arjuna‚Äôs wife. As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya. Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberal
brƒÅhma·πáa
he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dh·πõ·π£·π≠adyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra, Dh·πõ·π£·π≠adyumna took the side of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya. Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya‚Äôs so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, who were also Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya‚Äôs affectionate students. Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student. Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat."

Even though Dh·πõ·π£·π≠adyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face of Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya‚Äôs very great power in the military art, there were many others who were causes of fear. They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as formidable as Bhƒ´ma and Arjuna. He knew the strength of Bhƒ´ma and Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them."

Duryodhana mentions the exceptional heroes in¬†¬†the battle, all of whom are ever victorious. Vikar·πáa is the brother of Duryodhana, A≈õvatthƒÅmƒÅ is the son of Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya, and Saumadatti, or Bh≈´ri≈õravƒÅ, is the son of the King of the BƒÅhlƒ´kas. Kar·πáa is the half brother of Arjuna, as he was born of Kuntƒ´ before her marriage with King PƒÅ·πá·∏çu. K·πõpƒÅcƒÅrya‚Äôs twin sister married Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya."

As far as the others are concerned ‚Äì like Jayadratha, K·πõtavarmƒÅ and ≈öalya ‚Äì all are determined to lay down their lives for Duryodhana‚Äôs sake. In other words, it is already concluded that all of them would die in the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra for joining the party of the sinful Duryodhana. Duryodhana was, of course, confident of his victory on account of the above-mentioned combined strength of his friends."

Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhƒ´·π£ma, whereas the strength of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, carefully protected by Bhƒ´ma, is limited.","Purport
Herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by Duryodhana. He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bhƒ´·π£ma. On the other hand, the forces of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bhƒ´ma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bhƒ´·π£ma. Duryodhana was always envious of Bhƒ´ma because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bhƒ´ma. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bhƒ´·π£ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained."

All of you must now give full support to Grandfather Bhƒ´·π£ma, as you stand at your respective strategic points of entrance into the phalanx of the army.","Purport
Duryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bhƒ´·π£ma, further considered that others might think that they had been considered less important, so in his usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words. He emphasized that Bhƒ´·π£madeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx. Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bhƒ´·π£madeva. He was confident of the full support of Bhƒ´·π£madeva and Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna‚Äôs wife Draupadƒ´, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to appear naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, he hoped that these generals would now completely give it up, as they had done during the gambling performances."

The grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion. Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection."

On the other side, both Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.","Purport
In contrast with the conchshell blown by Bhƒ´·π£madeva, the conchshells in the hands of K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because K·πõ·π£·πáa was on the side of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas.

Victory is always with persons like the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu because Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Vi·π£·πáu, or Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated had been donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds."

Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa blew His conchshell, called PƒÅ√±cajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bhƒ´ma, the voracious eater and performer of herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell, called Pau·πá·∏çra.","Purport
Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is referred to as H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa in this verse because He is the owner of all senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhus≈´dana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is VƒÅsudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devakƒ´-nandana because He accepted Devakƒ´ as His mother; His name is Ya≈õodƒÅ-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya≈õodƒÅ at V·πõndƒÅvana; His name is PƒÅrtha-sƒÅrathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra.
Arjuna is referred to as Dhana√±jaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the king to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bhƒ´ma is known as V·πõkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi·∏çimba. So the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, beginning with the Lord‚Äôs, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So they were predestined to lose the battle ‚Äì and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells."

The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious. Vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra.","Purport
When Bhƒ´·π£ma and the others on the side of Duryodhana blew their respective conchshells, there was no heart-breaking on the part of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas. Such occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas‚Äô party. This is due to the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas and their confidence in Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. One who takes shelter of the Supreme Lord has nothing to fear, even in the midst of the greatest calamity."

The battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above statement that the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected arrangement of military force by the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, who were guided by the direct instructions of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa on the battlefield. The emblem of HanumƒÅn on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because HanumƒÅn cooperated with Lord RƒÅma in the battle between RƒÅma and RƒÅva·πáa, and Lord RƒÅma emerged victorious. Now both RƒÅma and HanumƒÅn were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is RƒÅma Himself, and wherever Lord RƒÅma is, His eternal servitor HanumƒÅn and His eternal consort Sƒ´tƒÅ, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory."

It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra. Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them on the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because K·πõ·π£·πáa was sitting by his side."

Sa√±jaya said: O descendant of Bharata, having thus been addressed by Arjuna, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.","Purport
In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu·∏çƒÅke≈õa.
Gu·∏çƒÅkƒÅ
means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called
gu·∏çƒÅke≈õa.
Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. As a great devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa, he could not forget K·πõ·π£·πáa even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs name, form, qualities and pastimes. Thus a devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa constantly. This is called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, or
samƒÅdhi.
As H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K·πõ·π£·πáa could understand Arjuna‚Äôs purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows."

As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word PƒÅrtha, meaning ‚Äúthe son of P·πõthƒÅ, or Kuntƒ´,‚Äù is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P·πõthƒÅ, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did K·πõ·π£·πáa mean when He told Arjuna to ‚Äúbehold the Kurus‚Äù? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? K·πõ·π£·πáa never expected such things from the son of His aunt P·πõthƒÅ. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicted by the Lord in friendly joking."

Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And while he was so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna‚Äôs bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:

‚ÄúOne who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.‚Äù (

There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna‚Äôs symptoms in this situation are out of material fear ‚Äì namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow GƒÅ·πá·∏çƒ´va was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin.

nimittƒÅni viparƒ´tƒÅni

Arjuna is showing ignorance of his real self-interest by K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs will. One‚Äôs real self-interest lies in Vi·π£·πáu, or K·πõ·π£·πáa. The conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him."

Without knowing that one‚Äôs self-interest is in Vi·π£·πáu (or K·πõ·π£·πáa), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations. In such a blind conception of life, they forget even the causes of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a
k·π£atriya.
It is said that two kinds of men, namely the
k·π£atriya
who dies directly in front of the battlefield under K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a
k·π£atriya,
he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the
k·π£atriyas
cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has no kingdom. Arjuna‚Äôs sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lies in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration."

According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: (1) a poison giver, (2) one who sets fire to the house, (3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, (4) one who plunders riches, (5) one who occupies another‚Äôs land, and (6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a
k·π£atriya.
Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly. For example, Lord RƒÅma was so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of Lord RƒÅma (
rƒÅma-rƒÅjya
), but Lord RƒÅma never showed any cowardice. RƒÅva·πáa was an aggressor against RƒÅma because RƒÅva·πáa kidnapped RƒÅma‚Äôs wife, Sƒ´tƒÅ, but Lord RƒÅma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna‚Äôs case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna‚Äôs addressing of K·πõ·π£·πáa as ‚ÄúMƒÅdhava,‚Äù or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K·πõ·π£·πáa that, as the husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K·πõ·π£·πáa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."

Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama
religion‚Äôs principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to CƒÅ·πáakya Pa·πá·∏çita, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama
system. On the failure of such
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma,
naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence."

According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Vi·π£·πáu, because eating the remnants of food offered to Vi·π£·πáu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful reactions. Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of
prasƒÅdam
food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in the

Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted K·πõ·π£·πáa to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress ‚Äì the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a

and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the

was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the value of life. They lead not to higher planets but to infamy.","Purport
K·πõ·π£·πáa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is referred to as BhagavƒÅn throughout the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
BhagavƒÅn is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and BhagavƒÅn, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(1.2.11)
this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattva·πÅ yaj j√±ƒÅnam advayam
brahmeti paramƒÅtmeti
bhagavƒÅn iti ≈õabdyate
‚ÄúThe Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and BhagavƒÅn.‚Äù
These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun‚Äôs surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun‚Äôs surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine ‚Äì its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature ‚Äì may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the
bhaktas,
or the transcendentalists who have realized the BhagavƒÅn feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.
The Sanskrit word
bhagavƒÅn
is explained by the great authority ParƒÅ≈õara Muni, the father of VyƒÅsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called BhagavƒÅn. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K·πõ·π£·πáa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including BrahmƒÅ, Lord ≈öiva or NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, can possess opulences as fully as K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore it is concluded in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
by Lord BrahmƒÅ himself that Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or BhagavƒÅn, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes:
ƒ´≈õvara·∏• parama·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa·∏•
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraha·∏•
anƒÅdir ƒÅdir govinda·∏•
sarva-kƒÅra·πáa-kƒÅra·πáam
‚ÄúThere are many personalities possessing the qualities of BhagavƒÅn, but K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.‚Äù (
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
5.1
)
In the
BhƒÅgavatam
also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but K·πõ·π£·πáa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:
ete cƒÅ·πÅ≈õa-kalƒÅ·∏• pu·πÅsa·∏•
k·πõ·π£·πáas tu bhagavƒÅn svayam
indrƒÅri-vyƒÅkula·πÅ loka·πÅ

‚ÄúAll the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.‚Äù (
BhƒÅg.
1.3.28
)
Therefore, K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.
In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna‚Äôs lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K·πõ·π£·πáa expressed His surprise with the word
kuta·∏•,
‚Äúwherefrom.‚Äù Such impurities were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as ƒÄryans. The word
ƒÅryan
is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Vi·π£·πáu, or BhagavƒÅn, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-ƒÄryans. Although Arjuna was a
k·π£atriya,
he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-ƒÄryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen."

Arjuna was addressed as the son of P·πõthƒÅ, who happened to be the sister of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. If the son of a

declines to fight, he is a

k·π£atriyas
and
brƒÅhma·πáas
are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, K·πõ·π£·πáa did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a
k·π£atriya.
Arjuna was the most intimate friend of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and K·πõ·π£·πáa was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act. Therefore K·πõ·π£·πáa said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhƒ´·π£ma and his relatives, but K·πõ·π£·πáa considered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart. Such false magnanimity was not approved by any authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of K·πõ·π£·πáa."

Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the
k·π£atriyas,
or whether he should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely proved that not only was he a great devotee of the Lord but he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa (his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships."

By nature‚Äôs own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.
Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the
B·πõhad-ƒÅra·πáyaka Upani·π£ad
(3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as follows:
yo vƒÅ etad ak·π£ara·πÅ gƒÅrgy aviditvƒÅsmƒÅ·∏ª lokƒÅt praiti sa k·πõpa·πáa·∏•.
‚ÄúHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.‚Äù This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the
brƒÅhma·πáa,
or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.
Ya etad ak·π£ara·πÅ gƒÅrgi viditvƒÅsmƒÅl lokƒÅt praiti sa brƒÅhma·πáa·∏•.
The
k·πõpa·πáas,
or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of ‚Äúskin disease.‚Äù The
k·πõpa·πáa
thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the
k·πõpa·πáa
thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to K·πõ·π£·πáa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K·πõ·π£·πáa is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
How Arjuna understands the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is stated in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to K·πõ·π£·πáa as a person, but to ‚Äúthe unborn within K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù There is no difference between K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ."

Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can be given only by a spiritual master like K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is a master in the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.
kibƒÅ vipra, kibƒÅ nyƒÅsƒ´, ≈õ≈´dra kene naya
yei k·πõ·π£·πáa-tattva-vettƒÅ, sei ‚Äòguru‚Äô haya
‚ÄúIt does not matter whether a person is a
vipra
[learned scholar in Vedic wisdom], or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life ‚Äì if he is a master in the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master.‚Äù (
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta, Madhya
8.128
) So without being a master in the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in the Vedic literature:
·π£a·π≠-karma-nipu·πáo vipro
mantra-tantra-vi≈õƒÅrada·∏•
avai·π£·πáavo gurur na syƒÅd
vai·π£·πáava·∏• ≈õva-paco guru·∏•
‚ÄúA scholarly
brƒÅhma·πáa,
expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vai·π£·πáava, or expert in the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai·π£·πáava, or K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious.‚Äù (
Padma PurƒÅ·πáa
)
The problems of material existence ‚Äì birth, old age, disease and death ‚Äì cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they can achieve real happiness only if they consult K·πõ·π£·πáa, or the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
‚Äì which constitute the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì through the bona fide representative of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the man in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
If economic development and material comforts could drive away one‚Äôs lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivaled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would be unable to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
confirms this:
k·π£ƒ´·πáe pu·πáye martya-loka·πÅ vi≈õanti.
‚ÄúWhen the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.‚Äù Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.
Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of K·πõ·π£·πáa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K·πõ·π£·πáa to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and would then surely fight.

As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord agrees to be a friend, a son or a lover for a devotee who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master ‚Äì with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefited. So the talks of

Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body."

The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned and in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord‚Äôs eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.
The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of
mƒÅyƒÅ,
or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K·πõ·π£·πáa clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the
Upani·π£ads,
will continue eternally. This statement of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs is authoritative because K·πõ·π£·πáa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality were not a fact, then K·πõ·π£·πáa would not have stressed it so much ‚Äì even for the future. The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ may argue that the individuality spoken of by K·πõ·π£·πáa is not spiritual, but material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs individuality? K·πõ·π£·πáa affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K·πõ·π£·πáa has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing. The
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
When one accepts K·πõ·π£·πáa as an ordinary man, the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
loses all importance. The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K·πõ·π£·πáa to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great
ƒÅcƒÅryas
like ≈örƒ´ RƒÅmƒÅnuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee‚Äôs approach to the teachings of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is something like that of a bee licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the mysticism of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ explanation of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´s and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the
Vedas
as above mentioned."

As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.","Purport
Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth ‚Äì either material or spiritual ‚Äì there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhƒ´·π£ma nor for Dro·πáa, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one‚Äôs work in life. So Bhƒ´·π£ma and Dro·πáa, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.
Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature ‚Äì both material and spiritual ‚Äì is called a
dhƒ´ra,
or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.
The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained, on the ground that the spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul‚Äôs being unchangeable. As confirmed in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ,
the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (
sanƒÅtana
) and are called
k·π£ara;
that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation the individual soul remains the same ‚Äì fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul, who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. He is different from the individual living entity. When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with K·πõ·π£·πáa, and K·πõ·π£·πáa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (
mƒÅyƒÅ
), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of
mƒÅyƒÅ,
no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgetful soul deluded by
mƒÅyƒÅ."

In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month of MƒÅgha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath. Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the
k·π£atriyas,
and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge, because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of

The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother‚Äôs side; and to address him as BhƒÅrata signifies his greatness from his father‚Äôs side. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot avoid fighting."

But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly, in Arjuna‚Äôs discharge of duties as a
k·π£atriya,
he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took
sannyƒÅsa
at the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took
sannyƒÅsa
and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage."

Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent [the material body] there is no endurance and of the eternal [the soul] there is no change. This they have concluded by studying the nature of both.","Purport
There is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the
Vi·π£·πáu PurƒÅ·πáa
(2.12.38) it is stated that Vi·π£·πáu and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence (
jyotƒ´·πÅ·π£i vi·π£·πáur bhuvanƒÅni vi·π£·πáu·∏•
). The words
existent
and
nonexistent
refer only to spirit and matter. That is the version of all seers of truth.
This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole. In the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tras,
as well as in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and the energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time."

That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul.","Purport
This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one‚Äôs own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul‚Äôs presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
(5.9) confirms this:
bƒÅlƒÅgra-≈õata-bhƒÅgasya
≈õatadhƒÅ kalpitasya ca
bhƒÅgo jƒ´va·∏• sa vij√±eya·∏•
sa cƒÅnantyƒÅya kalpate
‚ÄúWhen the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.‚Äù Similarly the same version is stated:
ke≈õƒÅgra-≈õata-bhƒÅgasya

sa·πÖkhyƒÅtƒ´to hi cit-ka·πáa·∏•
‚ÄúThere are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.‚Äù
Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the
Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad
(3.1.9) the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:
e·π£o ‚Äô·πáur ƒÅtmƒÅ cetasƒÅ veditavyo

prƒÅ·πáai≈õ citta·πÅ sarvam ota·πÅ prajƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ
yasmin vi≈õuddhe vibhavaty e·π£a ƒÅtmƒÅ
‚ÄúThe soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air (
prƒÅ·πáa, apƒÅna, vyƒÅna, samƒÅna
and
udƒÅna
), is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.‚Äù
The
ha·π≠ha-yoga
system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures ‚Äì not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.
So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading
vi·π£·πáu-tattva.
The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the
Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad,
this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul passes away from this position, the activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.
Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name
prabhƒÅ,
or superior energy. So whether one follows Vedic knowledge or modern science, one cannot deny the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
by the Personality of Godhead Himself."

The material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tras
the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily considerations."

The Vedic injunction is

Qualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or
k≈´·π≠a-stha.
The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth from the womb of the mother‚Äôs body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing and primeval ‚Äì that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul‚Äôs presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.
In the
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
(1.2.18) we also find a similar passage, which reads:
na jƒÅyate mriyate vƒÅ vipa≈õcin
nƒÅya·πÅ kuta≈õcin na babh≈´va ka≈õcit
ajo nitya·∏• ≈õƒÅ≈õvato ‚Äôya·πÅ purƒÅ·πáo
na hanyate hanyamƒÅne ≈õarƒ´re
The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
but here in this verse there is one special word,
vipa≈õcit,
which means learned or with knowledge.
The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies ‚Äì whether man or animal ‚Äì we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge ‚Äì past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K·πõ·π£·πáa. But K·πõ·π£·πáa is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs teachings of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
would be useless.
There are two kinds of souls ‚Äì namely the minute particle soul (
a·πáu-ƒÅtmƒÅ
) and the Supersoul (
vibhu-ƒÅtmƒÅ
). This is also confirmed in the
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
(1.2.20) in this way:
a·πáor a·πáƒ´yƒÅn mahato mahƒ´yƒÅn

‚ÄúBoth the Supersoul [ParamƒÅtmƒÅ] and the atomic soul [‚Äâ

Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility. Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed, because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. In
Manu-sa·πÅhitƒÅ,
the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king‚Äôs punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K·πõ·π£·πáa orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thus Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for K·πõ·π£·πáa, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of K·πõ·π£·πáa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction."

Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in a previous verse (2.13).
Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The
Vedas,
like the
Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad,
as well as the
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad,
compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K·πõ·π£·πáa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds ‚Äì although they are the same in quality ‚Äì one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one‚Äôs changing his position from one tree to another, or from one body to another. The
jƒ´va
soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master ‚Äì as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa for instruction ‚Äì the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the
Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad
(3.1.2) and
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
(4.7) confirm this:
samƒÅne v·πõk·π£e puru·π£o nimagno

ju·π£·π≠a·πÅ yadƒÅ pa≈õyaty anyam ƒ´≈õam

‚ÄúAlthough the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend the Lord and knows His glories ‚Äì at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.‚Äù Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K·πõ·π£·πáa, and is understanding the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
from Him. And thus, hearing from K·πõ·π£·πáa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.
Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna‚Äôs lamentation."

The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.","Purport
All kinds of weapons ‚Äì swords, flame weapons, rain weapons, tornado weapons, etc. ‚Äì are unable to kill the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements. Fire weapons were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.
The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ cannot explain how the individual soul came into existence simply by ignorance and consequently became covered by the illusory energy. Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Supreme Soul; rather, the individual souls are eternally separated parts of the Supreme Soul. Because they are atomic individual souls eternally (
sanƒÅtana
), they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of a fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the
VarƒÅha PurƒÅ·πáa,
the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme. They are eternally so, according to the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
also. So, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from K·πõ·π£·πáa, but he never became one with K·πõ·π£·πáa."

All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.
The word
sarva-gata
(‚Äúall-pervading‚Äù) is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God‚Äôs creation. They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire.

As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul‚Äôs existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of
≈õruti,
or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no source of understanding the soul except by studying the
Vedas.
In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious ‚Äì that also is the statement of the
Vedas,
and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the
Vedas
in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error."

If, however, you think that the soul [or the symptoms of life] will always be born and die forever, you still have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.","Purport
There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa spoke the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the LokƒÅyatikas and VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas. Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions ‚Äì now becoming fashionable in America ‚Äì are also adhering to this philosophy, as are the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.
Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul ‚Äì as in the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika philosophy ‚Äì there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika philosophy, the so-called soul or
ƒÅtmƒÅ
vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul or he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such incidents. If there were no rebirth for the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected by sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K·πõ·π£·πáa sarcastically addressed Arjuna as
mahƒÅ-bƒÅhu,
mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the VaibhƒÅ·π£ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a

Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles."

One has to take birth according to one‚Äôs activities of life. And after finishing one term of activities, one has to die to take birth for the next. In this way one is going through one cycle of birth and death after another without liberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.
The Battle of Kuruk·π£etra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a

By avoiding the discharge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop the death of his relatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of action."

All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?","Purport
Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of the soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument‚Äôs sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested ‚Äì that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.
And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (
antavanta ime dehƒÅ·∏•
) but that the soul is eternal (
nityasyoktƒÅ·∏• ≈õarƒ´ri·πáa·∏•
), then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body."

The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing. Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to BrahmƒÅ, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matters for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps they have no idea that one must think of the soul, and thus make a solution to the material miseries.
Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions and relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one‚Äôs life is successful.
The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
spoken by the greatest authority, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K·πõ·π£·πáa can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way."

Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the matter of good administration, is called
k·π£atriya. K·π£at
means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called
k·π£atriya
(
trƒÅyate
‚Äì to give protection). The
k·π£atriyas
are trained for killing in the forest. A
k·π£atriya
would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system has been followed even up to the present day by the
k·π£atriya
kings of Jaipur state. The
k·π£atriyas
are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore,
k·π£atriyas
are never meant for accepting directly the order of
sannyƒÅsa,
or renunciation. Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:

‚ÄúIn the battlefield, a king or
k·π£atriya,
while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving the heavenly planets after death, as the
brƒÅhma·πáas
also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.‚Äù Therefore, killing on the battlefield on religious principles and killing animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefited by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the
k·π£atriyas
killed on the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets, as do the
brƒÅhma·πáas
who attain them by offering sacrifice.
There are two kinds of
sva-dharmas,
specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of his particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one‚Äôs
sva-dharma
‚Äì specific duty ‚Äì becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the
brƒÅhma·πáas
and
k·π£atriyas
respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.
Sva-dharma
is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane
sva-dharma
is called
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma,
or man‚Äôs steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma,
or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one‚Äôs specific duty in any field of action in accordance with the orders of higher authorities serves to elevate one to a higher status of life."

As supreme teacher of the world, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa condemns the attitude of Arjuna, who said, ‚ÄúI do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause perpetual habitation in hell.‚Äù Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a
k·π£atriya
to be on the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the
ParƒÅ≈õara-sm·πõti,
or religious codes made by ParƒÅ≈õara, the great sage and father of VyƒÅsadeva, it is stated:

Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets, whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case."

Everyone knew that he was a great warrior. Even Dro·πáƒÅcƒÅrya gave him benedictions and awarded him the special weapon by which he could kill even his teacher.

That everything should be performed for the sake of K·πõ·π£·πáa is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad.

BhƒÅg.
11.5.41
) That is the indirect hint given by K·πõ·π£·πáa to Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses."
Bg. 2.39,"Verse text

Thus far I have described this knowledge to you through analytical study. Now listen as I explain it in terms of working without fruitive results. O son of P·πõthƒÅ, when you act in such knowledge you can free yourself from the bondage of works.","Purport
According to the
Nirukti,
or the Vedic dictionary,
sa·πÖkhyƒÅ
means that which describes things in detail, and
sƒÅ·πÖkhya
refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And
yoga
involves controlling the senses. Arjuna‚Äôs proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K·πõ·π£·πáa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as SƒÅ·πÖkhya, in terms of the
Nirukti
dictionary. This SƒÅ·πÖkhya has nothing to do with the SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila‚Äôs SƒÅ·πÖkhya, the SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy was expounded in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, who explained it to His mother, Devah≈´ti. It is clearly explained by Him that the
puru·π£a,
or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the
prak·πõti.
This is accepted in the
Vedas
and in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
The description in the
Vedas
indicates that the Lord glanced over the
prak·πõti,
or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of
mƒÅyƒÅ,
or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto VƒÅsudeva, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.
Arjuna has already accepted K·πõ·π£·πáa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him:
≈õi·π£yas te ‚Äôha·πÅ ≈õƒÅdhi mƒÅ·πÅ tvƒÅ·πÅ prapannam.
Consequently, K·πõ·π£·πáa will now tell him about the working process in
buddhi-yoga,
or
karma-yoga,
or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord. This
buddhi-yoga
is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ in everyone‚Äôs heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, attains to this stage of
buddhi-yoga
by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.
Thus the
buddhi-yoga
mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word SƒÅ·πÖkhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga
enunciated by the imposter Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga
mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic SƒÅ·πÖkhya. Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
but even that SƒÅ·πÖkhya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, SƒÅ·πÖkhya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of
buddhi-yoga,
or
bhakti-yoga.
Therefore, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs SƒÅ·πÖkhya and Lord Kapila‚Äôs SƒÅ·πÖkhya, as described in the
BhƒÅgavatam,
are one and the same. They are all
bhakti-yoga.
Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga
and
bhakti-yoga
(
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yogau p·πõthag bƒÅlƒÅ·∏• pravadanti na pa·πá·∏çitƒÅ·∏•
).
Of course, atheistic
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga
has nothing to do with
bhakti-yoga,
yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga
is referred to in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
One should therefore understand that
buddhi-yoga
means to work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of
buddhi-yoga
and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental understanding automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness.
Buddhi-yoga
is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform."

Activity in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, or acting for the benefit of K·πõ·π£·πáa without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent, whereas in material activity without a hundred percent success there is no profit. AjƒÅmila performed his duty in some percentage of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(1.5.17)
:

‚ÄúIf someone gives up his occupational duties and works in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?‚Äù Or, as the Christians say, ‚ÄúWhat profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffer the loss of his eternal soul?‚Äù
Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness carries a person again to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, even after the loss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured
brƒÅhma·πáa
or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation. That is the unique quality of work done in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

When one is awake in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is automatically achieved by progressive K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
The resolute purpose of a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is based on knowledge.
VƒÅsudeva·∏• sarvam iti sa mahƒÅtmƒÅ su-durlabha·∏•:
a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the rare good soul who knows perfectly that VƒÅsudeva, or K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the root of all manifested causes. As by watering the root of a tree one automatically distributes water to the leaves and branches, so by acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness one can render the highest service to everyone ‚Äì namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If K·πõ·π£·πáa is satisfied by one‚Äôs actions, then everyone will be satisfied.
Service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K·πõ·π£·πáa, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. As such, to be well versed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one‚Äôs mission in life. ≈örƒ´la Vi≈õvanƒÅtha Cakravartƒ´ ·π¨hƒÅkura instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:
yasya prasƒÅdƒÅd bhagavat-prasƒÅdo
yasyƒÅprasƒÅdƒÅn na gati·∏• kuto ‚Äôpi
dhyƒÅyan stuva·πÅs tasya ya≈õas tri-sandhya·πÅ
vande guro·∏• ≈õrƒ´-cara·πáƒÅravindam
‚ÄúBy satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.‚Äù
The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body ‚Äì not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer a chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts."

All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The
Vedas
deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of
VedƒÅnta
philosophy where, in the beginning, there is
brahma-jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ,
or questions on the supreme transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the
karma-kƒÅ·πá·∏ça
chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upani·π£ads,
which are part of different
Vedas,
as the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is a part of the fifth
Veda,
namely the
MahƒÅbhƒÅrata.
The
Upani·π£ads
mark the beginning of transcendental life.
As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of K·πõ·π£·πáa."

The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the
karma-kƒÅ·πá·∏ça
division of the Vedic literature are meant to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(15.15)
: the purpose of studying the
Vedas
is to know Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa and one‚Äôs eternal relationship with Him. The relationship of the living entities with K·πõ·π£·πáa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(15.7)
. The living entities are parts and parcels of K·πõ·π£·πáa; therefore, revival of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(3.33.7)
as follows:
aho bata ≈õva-paco ‚Äôto garƒ´yƒÅn
yaj-jihvƒÅgre vartate nƒÅma tubhyam

‚ÄúO my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a
ca·πá·∏çƒÅla
[dog-eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the ƒÄryan family.‚Äù
So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the
Vedas,
without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals, nor is it possible to study all of the
VedƒÅnta
and the
Upani·π£ads
thoroughly. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the
Vedas.
This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, PrakƒÅ≈õƒÅnanda Sarasvatƒ´, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying
VedƒÅnta
philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master had found Him to be a great fool and thus asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this Age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand
VedƒÅnta
philosophy; the best purpose of
VedƒÅnta
philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord.
VedƒÅnta
is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the
VedƒÅnta
philosophy is Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa; and the highest VedƒÅntist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism."

You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.","Purport
There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction. Prescribed duties are activities enjoined in terms of one‚Äôs acquired modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one‚Äôs prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.
As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work performed as an obligation in terms of the scriptural injunctions, without desire for results, is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietary right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.
Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful. Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna."

And what is that

Yoga
means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight. Gain or victory are K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The following of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs dictation is real
yoga,
and this is practiced in the process called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. By K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant of K·πõ·π£·πáa, or the servant of the servant of K·πõ·π£·πáa. That is the right way to discharge duty in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, which alone can help one to act in
yoga.
Arjuna is a
k·π£atriya,
and as such he is participating in the
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma
institution. It is said in the
Vi·π£·πáu PurƒÅ·πáa
that in the
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma,
the whole aim is to satisfy Vi·π£·πáu. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy K·πõ·π£·πáa. So unless one satisfies K·πõ·π£·πáa, one cannot correctly observe the principles of
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma.
Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as K·πõ·π£·πáa told him."

Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor.

Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that the resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life nor the influence of time and death. To know one‚Äôs constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living entity‚Äôs position and the Lord‚Äôs position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one who, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaiku·πá·π≠ha-loka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called
karma-yoga

If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the

One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness.","Purport
The test of a
yogƒ´,
devotee or self-realized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the
yogƒ´
is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The
yogƒ´,
or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents ‚Äì like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not‚Äôs, and some of them are do‚Äôs. Unless one is able to follow the do‚Äôs and the do-not‚Äôs, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up its senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Arjuna is being taught here to use his senses for the service of the Lord, instead of for his own satisfaction. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within."

Though the embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.","Purport
Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like
a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga,
in the matter of
yama, niyama, ƒÅsana, prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma, pratyƒÅhƒÅra, dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ, dhyƒÅna,
etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, in the course of his advancement in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good until one actually has a taste for K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. When one is actually K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things."

The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.","Purport
There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even Vi≈õvƒÅmitra, a great sage and perfect
yogƒ´,
was misled by MenakƒÅ into sex enjoyment, although the
yogƒ´
was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and
yoga
practice. And, of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and senses without being fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. Without engaging the mind in K·πõ·π£·πáa, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by ≈örƒ´ YƒÅmunƒÅcƒÅrya, a great saint and devotee, who says:
yad-avadhi mama ceta·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa-pƒÅdƒÅravinde

K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. MahƒÅrƒÅja Ambarƒ´·π£a also conquered a great
yogƒ´,
DurvƒÅsƒÅ Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness (

That the highest conception of
yoga
perfection is K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And unless one is K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage DurvƒÅsƒÅ Muni picked a quarrel with MahƒÅrƒÅja Ambarƒ´·π£a, and DurvƒÅsƒÅ Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the king, although not as powerful a
yogƒ´
as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage‚Äôs injustices and thereby emerged victorious. The king was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the

‚ÄúKing Ambarƒ´·π£a fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the

The word
mat-para
is most significant in this connection. How one can become

is described in the life of MahƒÅrƒÅja Ambarƒ´·π£a. ≈örƒ´la Baladeva VidyƒÅbh≈´·π£a·πáa, a great scholar and

also prescribes meditation on Vi·π£·πáu, and not meditation on the void. The so-called

One who is not K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of the senses. The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord ≈öiva and Lord BrahmƒÅ ‚Äì to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets ‚Äì is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. Lord ≈öiva was deep in meditation, but when PƒÅrvatƒ´ agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result KƒÅrtikeya was born. When HaridƒÅsa ·π¨hƒÅkura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of MƒÅyƒÅ-devƒ´, but HaridƒÅsa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of ≈örƒ´ YƒÅmunƒÅcƒÅrya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires."

By development of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. Their so-called renunciation is called
phalgu,
or less important. On the other hand, a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called
prasƒÅdam.
Thus everything becomes spiritualized, and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes
prasƒÅdam
in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life, due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service."

It is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some artificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is every chance of a fall. Although the person in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious he has no attachment to sensual activities. The K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment. If K·πõ·π£·πáa wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if K·πõ·π£·πáa does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of K·πõ·π£·πáa. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform."

One who is not connected with the Supreme [in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?","Purport
Unless one is in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, and that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa."

Although the vast ocean is always filled with water, it is always, especially during the rainy season, being filled with much more water.

As long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue. The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such desires, because of his fullness. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious man is not in need of anything, because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean ‚Äì always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is the proof of a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious man ‚Äì one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who want to fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the
yogƒ´s
who are after mystic powers are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But the person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of K·πõ·π£·πáa have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace."

A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego ‚Äì he alone can attain real peace.","Purport
To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becoming K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one‚Äôs actual position as the eternal servitor of K·πõ·π£·πáa, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K·πõ·π£·πáa is the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious he fought because K·πõ·π£·πáa wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K·πõ·π£·πáa the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K·πõ·π£·πáa (
ƒ´≈õƒÅvƒÅsyam ida·πÅ sarvam
), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization ‚Äì namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel of K·πõ·π£·πáa in spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level of K·πõ·π£·πáa or greater than Him. This understanding of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the basic principle of real peace."

One can attain K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness or divine life at once, within a second ‚Äì or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha·π≠vƒÅ·πÖga MahƒÅrƒÅja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K·πõ·π£·πáa.
NirvƒÅ·πáa
means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
teaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, he at once attains the stage of
brahma-nirvƒÅ·πáa.
There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Attainment of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.
Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore
brƒÅhmƒ´ sthiti
means ‚Äúnot on the platform of material activities.‚Äù Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
as the liberated stage (
sa gu·πáƒÅn samatƒ´tyaitƒÅn brahma-bh≈´yƒÅya kalpate
). Therefore,
brƒÅhmƒ´ sthiti
is liberation from material bondage.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa has very elaborately described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to delivering His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of realization has been recommended:
buddhi-yoga,
or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Sometimes K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. But without being trained in the philosophy of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K·πõ·π£·πáa in a secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness or
buddhi-yoga,
or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K·πõ·π£·πáa as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa elaborately explained
karma-yoga,
or work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, in this Third Chapter."

In the previous chapter, as a prelude to the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
many different paths were explained, such as
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga, buddhi-yoga,
control of the senses by intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte. This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although K·πõ·π£·πáa had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness ‚Äì either by inertia or by active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are two classes of men who try to realize the self. Some are inclined to understand it by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others by devotional service.","Purport
In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures ‚Äì namely
sƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga
and
karma-yoga,
or
buddhi-yoga.
In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly.
SƒÅ·πÖkhya-yoga,
or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, as it is explained in the sixty-first verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the thirty-ninth verse, that by working by the principles of
buddhi-yoga,
or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the sixty-first verse ‚Äì that this
buddhi-yoga
is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K·πõ·π£·πáa), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the
yogas
are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K·πõ·π£·πáa, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. This is also stated in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting everything with K·πõ·π£·πáa in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Of these two, the path of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime."

Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection.","Purport
The renounced order of life can be accepted when one has been purified by the discharge of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the hearts of materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (
sannyƒÅsa
). According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting
sannyƒÅsa,
or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa. But Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart,
sannyƒÅsa
is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (
buddhi-yoga
).

Everyone is forced to act helplessly according to the qualities he has acquired from the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.","Purport
It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by the illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the
≈õƒÅstras.
But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(1.5.17)
affirms this:

‚ÄúIf someone takes to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the

or execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the
≈õƒÅstras,
what does it avail him if he is not K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious?‚Äù So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Therefore,
sannyƒÅsa,
or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, without which everything is considered a failure."

There are many pretenders who refuse to work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness but make a show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a show of being a
yogƒ´
while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy. His knowledge has no value, because the effects of such a sinful man‚Äôs knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord. Such a pretender‚Äôs mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation has no value whatsoever."

Instead of becoming a pseudo transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one‚Äôs own business and execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of God. The prime
svƒÅrtha-gati,
or goal of self-interest, is to reach Vi·π£·πáu. The whole institution of
var·πáa
and
ƒÅ≈õrama
is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the
≈õƒÅstras,
and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress. A sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living."

Perform your prescribed duty, for doing so is better than not working. One cannot even maintain one‚Äôs physical body without work.","Purport
There are many pseudo meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa did not want Arjuna to become a pretender. Rather, the Lord desired that Arjuna perform his prescribed duties as set forth for
k·π£atriyas.
Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder
k·π£atriya.
Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to maintain one‚Äôs body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others."

Work done as a sacrifice for Vi·π£·πáu has to be performed; otherwise work causes bondage in this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntƒ´, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain free from bondage.","Purport
Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled.
Yaj√±a
means Lord Vi·π£·πáu, or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Vi·π£·πáu. The
Vedas
enjoin:
yaj√±o vai vi·π£·πáu·∏•.
In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed
yaj√±as
or directly serves Lord Vi·π£·πáu. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is therefore performance of
yaj√±a
as it is prescribed in this verse. The

(

3.8.8).
Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Vi·π£·πáu. Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness to satisfy K·πõ·π£·πáa (or Vi·π£·πáu); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, or under the direct instruction of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God."

The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi·π£·πáu) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home ‚Äì back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Vi·π£·πáu, or K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation, as it is stated in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ: vedai≈õ ca sarvair aham eva vedya·∏•.
The Lord says that the purpose of the
Vedas
is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said:
pati·πÅ vi≈õvasyƒÅtme≈õvaram.
Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi·π£·πáu. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
also (2.4.20) ≈örƒ´la ≈öukadeva GosvƒÅmƒ´ describes the Lord as
pati
in so many ways:

The
prajƒÅ-pati
is Lord Vi·π£·πáu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world to enable the conditioned souls to learn how to perform
yaj√±as
(sacrifices) for the satisfaction of Vi·π£·πáu, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety, and after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of
yaj√±a,
the conditioned souls gradually become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious and become godly in all respects. In the Age of Kali, the
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a
(the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age.
Sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a
and K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness go well together. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(11.5.32)
as follows, with special reference to the
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a:

‚Äù Other
yaj√±as
prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this Age of Kali, but the

also (9.14)."

The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you, and thus, by cooperation between men and demigods, prosperity will reign for all.","Purport
The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity is entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on the performance of
yaj√±as
by the human being. Some of the
yaj√±as
are meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Vi·π£·πáu is worshiped in all
yaj√±as
as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
that K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of

are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products.
Performance of
yaj√±as
has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from material bondage. By performance of
yaj√±as,
all activities become purified, as it is stated in the

In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yaj√±a [sacrifice], will supply all necessities to you. But he who enjoys such gifts without offering them to the demigods in return is certainly a thief.","Purport
The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi·π£·πáu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed
yaj√±as.
In the
Vedas,
there are different kinds of
yaj√±as
prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of
yaj√±as
are recommended in the
Vedas.
Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis ‚Äì namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess KƒÅlƒ´, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Vi·π£·πáu is recommended. But ultimately all
yaj√±as
are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five
yaj√±as,
known as
pa√±ca-mahƒÅ-yaj√±a,
are necessary.
One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life ‚Äì none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials ‚Äì all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of
yaj√±as.
If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy, because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform
yaj√±as.
Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of
yaj√±a,
namely the
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a,
which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, are called

Therefore, such devotees always perform
yaj√±as
in different modes of devotional service, such as
≈õrava·πáam, kƒ´rtanam, smara·πáam, arcanam,
etc., and these performances of
yaj√±as
keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves but also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a,

≈örƒ´la Baladeva VidyƒÅbh≈´·π£a·πáa, a great commentator on the

The Supreme Lord, who is known as the
yaj√±a-puru·π£a,
or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra and Varu·πáa are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the
Vedas
direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, offer food to K·πõ·π£·πáa and then eat ‚Äì a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi·π£·πáu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, who eats only food offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting
prasƒÅdam
of the Lord (food offered to Vi·π£·πáu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.
Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity ‚Äì that is the law of nature.
Yaj√±a,
specifically the
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana-yaj√±a
prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."

Yaj√±ƒÅrtha-karma,
or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa only, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of the
yaj√±a-puru·π£a,
Vi·π£·πáu, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental
Vedas
. The
Vedas
are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the
Vedas
is called
vikarma,
or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the
Vedas
to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the
Vedas
are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said,
asya mahato bh≈´tasya ni≈õvasitam etad yad ·πõg-vedo yajur-veda·∏• sƒÅma-vedo ‚ÄôtharvƒÅ·πÖgirasa·∏•.
‚ÄúThe four
Vedas
‚Äì namely the
·πög Veda, Yajur Veda, SƒÅma Veda
and
Atharva Veda
‚Äì are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.‚Äù (
B·πõhad-ƒÅra·πáyaka Upani·π£ad
4.5.11) The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, for as it is confirmed in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ,
the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one‚Äôs perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of
yaj√±a
by becoming K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic
yaj√±as,
or
karmas

My dear Arjuna, one who does not follow in human life the cycle of sacrifice thus established by the Vedas certainly leads a life full of sin. Living only for the satisfaction of the senses, such a person lives in vain.","Purport
The mammonist philosophy of ‚Äúwork very hard and enjoy sense gratification‚Äù is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing
yaj√±as
is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature‚Äôs law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways ‚Äì namely
karma-yoga, j√±ƒÅna-yoga
or
bhakti-yoga.
There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed
yaj√±as
for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of
yaj√±a
performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The
yaj√±a
system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the
yaj√±as
are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the
Vedas.
Indirectly, it is the practice of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, because when one masters the performance of
yaj√±as
one is sure to become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. But if by performing
yaj√±as
one does not become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

A person who is

yaj√±a
performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and therefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations."

Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme.","Purport
The Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees, and liberation for the impersonalist. A person, therefore, acting for K·πõ·π£·πáa, or in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra for the interest of K·πõ·π£·πáa because K·πõ·π£·πáa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without attachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa.
Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of K·πõ·π£·πáa alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely nonattached."

Kings such as Janaka attained perfection solely by performance of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work.","Purport
Kings like Janaka were all self-realized souls; consequently they had no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the
Vedas.
Nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in general. Janaka was the father of Sƒ´tƒÅ and father-in-law of Lord ≈örƒ´ RƒÅma. Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because he was the king of MithilƒÅ (a subdivision of Bihar province in India), he had to teach his subjects how to perform prescribed duties. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna, the Lord‚Äôs eternal friend, had no need to fight in the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra, but they fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse."

Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.","Purport
People in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called
ƒÅcƒÅrya,
or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of
≈õƒÅstra
(scripture) to teach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like
Manu-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader‚Äôs teaching should be based on the principles of such standard
≈õƒÅstras.
One who desires to improve himself must follow the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the schoolteacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general. All such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependents; therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes."

‚ÄúThe Supreme Lord is the controller of all other controllers, and He is the greatest of all the diverse planetary leaders. Everyone is under His control. All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; they are not supreme themselves. He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the supreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.
‚ÄúHe does not possess a bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other sense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him.

(

Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty, but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly has no duty. And yet Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is engaged on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra as the leader of the
k·π£atriyas

Var·πáa-sa·πÖkara
is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The

Persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is called

Ignorant men think of the body as the self; they accept bodily connections with others as kinsmanship, the land in which the body is obtained is their object of worship, and they consider the formalities of religious rituals to be ends in themselves. Social work, nationalism and altruism are some of the activities for such materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and so they are not interested. Those who are enlightened in spiritual life, however, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one‚Äôs own spiritual activities silently. Such bewildered persons may be engaged in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work.
Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and therefore Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time.

This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The Lord instructs that one has to become fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K·πõ·π£·πáa, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was therefore ordered by ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, is called
adhyƒÅtma-cetƒÅs. NirƒÅ≈õƒ´·∏•
means that one has to act on the order of the master but should not expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of
mayi,
or ‚Äúunto Me.‚Äù And when one acts in such K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called
nirmama,
or ‚Äúnothing is mine.‚Äù And if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become
vigata-jvara,
or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation."

but have no faith in K·πõ·π£·πáa. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of
karma.
In the beginning of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of
mƒÅyƒÅ
simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence. Therefore, without being fully in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one should not give up his occupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called
yogƒ´
or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one‚Äôs position and to try to attain K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs

There are principles to regulate attachment and aversion pertaining to the senses and their objects. One should not come under the control of such attachment and aversion, because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.","Purport
Those who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratification. But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one‚Äôs wife. All other women are to be considered as one‚Äôs mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratification under regulations may also lead one to go astray ‚Äì as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But attachment to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, or acting always in the loving service of K·πõ·π£·πáa, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Materially, prescribed duties are duties enjoined according to one‚Äôs psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another‚Äôs prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a
k·π£atriya,
who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a
k·π£atriya
it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a
brƒÅhma·πáa
who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the
k·π£atriya
may act as a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
or a
brƒÅhma·πáa
may act as a
k·π£atriya.
In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Vi≈õvƒÅmitra was originally a
k·π£atriya,
but later on he acted as a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
whereas Para≈õurƒÅma was a
brƒÅhma·πáa
but later on he acted as a
k·π£atriya.
Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

A living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual, pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not subject to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes even against his will. As such, Arjuna‚Äôs question to K·πõ·π£·πáa is very sanguine, as to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. Sinful actions are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.","Purport
When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for K·πõ·π£·πáa is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.
This inquiry is the beginning of the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tras,
wherein it is said,
athƒÅto brahma-jij√±ƒÅsƒÅ:
one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
as
janmƒÅdy asya yato ‚ÄônvayƒÅd itarata≈õ ca,
or, ‚ÄúThe origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman.‚Äù Therefore the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness ‚Äì or, in other words, desiring everything for K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. HanumƒÅn, the great servitor of Lord RƒÅma, exhibited his wrath by burning the golden city of RƒÅva·πáa, but by doing so he became the greatest devotee of the Lord. Here also, in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Lord induces Arjuna to engage his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies."

As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust.","Purport
There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke-covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness under able guidance."

or the shackles of sex life. In the ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life. Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore, this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer."

The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul, and therefore Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is giving hints of those places, so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus when we hear about sense objects the mind generally becomes a reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the

‚ÄúThe knowledge of the self and Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if explained with their various aspects by the Lord Himself.‚Äù
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
gives us that general and specific knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious and act accordingly.
Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity. But if one is educated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead ‚Äì the highest perfectional stage of human life."

The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.","Purport
The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. In K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act ‚Äì as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In the
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
there is a similar passage, in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained.
Para·πÅ d·πõ·π£·π≠vƒÅ nivartate.
If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
the soul has been described as
mahƒÅn,
the great. Therefore the soul is above all ‚Äì namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.
With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of the senses. But aside from that, one has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one‚Äôs mind in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K·πõ·π£·πáa in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind."

This Third Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is conclusively directive to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness the ultimate end. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind ‚Äì by steady intelligence directed toward one‚Äôs pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness by higher intelligence.

Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.
In this millennium, the sun-god is known as VivasvƒÅn, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ

The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order.‚Äù
The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name VivasvƒÅn) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa originally made VivasvƒÅn His first disciple to understand the science of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial.
In the
MahƒÅbhƒÅrata
(
≈öƒÅnti-parva

‚ÄúIn the beginning of the millennium known as TretƒÅ-yuga this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by VivasvƒÅn to Manu. Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son MahƒÅrƒÅja Ik·π£vƒÅku, the king of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty, in which Lord RƒÅmacandra appeared.‚Äù Therefore,
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
existed in human society from the time of MahƒÅrƒÅja Ik·π£vƒÅku.
At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was DvƒÅpara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was TretƒÅ-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
to his disciple and son MahƒÅrƒÅja Ik·π£vƒÅku, the king of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
was spoken by the Lord to His disciple the sun-god VivasvƒÅn, a rough estimate is that the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ,

itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. It was spoken to the sun-god VivasvƒÅn because he is also a

Because
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is as good as the
Vedas,
being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is
apauru·π£eya,
superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the
Gƒ´tƒÅ

Gƒ´tƒÅ
in their own ways, but that is not
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
as it is. Therefore,
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ik·π£vƒÅku."

It is clearly stated that the

was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one‚Äôs benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
(especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, although they make a good business on the words of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
in English, as it is received by the
paramparƒÅ
(disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want.

Arjuna said: The sun-god VivasvƒÅn is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?","Purport
Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K·πõ·π£·πáa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K·πõ·π£·πáa. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course, K·πõ·π£·πáa also appeared as the son of Devakƒ´ on this earth. How K·πõ·π£·πáa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K·πõ·π£·πáa so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K·πõ·π£·πáa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K·πõ·π£·πáa would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, when K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K·πõ·π£·πáa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K·πõ·π£·πáa when they are spoken by K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K·πõ·π£·πáa because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K·πõ·π£·πáa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K·πõ·π£·πáa is superhuman, that He is
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraha
‚Äì the eternal form of bliss and knowledge ‚Äì that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Arjuna‚Äôs putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider K·πõ·π£·πáa to be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature."

we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:

Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.‚Äù
It is also stated in
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.39)
:

‚ÄúI worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K·πõ·π£·πáa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as RƒÅma, N·πõsi·πÅha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K·πõ·π£·πáa, and who incarnates personally also.‚Äù
In the
Vedas
also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the
vaid≈´rya
stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the
Vedas
(
vede·π£u durlabham adurlabham ƒÅtma-bhaktau
). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa spoke the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
to the sun-god VivasvƒÅn, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
as infallible (
acyuta
), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
cannot be understood by demonic brains. K·πõ·π£·πáa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda
body. He is
advaita,
which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit ‚Äì whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord‚Äôs body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse."

Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, by My internal energy I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.","Purport
The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past ‚Äúbirths,‚Äù whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K·πõ·π£·πáa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His
prak·πõti,
or His form.
Prak·πõti
means ‚Äúnature,‚Äù as well as
svar≈´pa,
or ‚Äúone‚Äôs own form.‚Äù The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K·πõ·π£·πáa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K·πõ·π£·πáa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation ‚Äì past, present and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance are like the sun‚Äôs rising, moving before us and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun has set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency ‚Äì and He is never contaminated by material nature. The
Vedas
also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In the
BhƒÅgavatam,
He appears before His mother as NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord‚Äôs forms to be. The word
mƒÅyƒÅ,
or
ƒÅtma-mƒÅyƒÅ,
refers to the Lord‚Äôs causeless mercy, according to the
Vi≈õva-ko≈õa
dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse."

The word
s·πõjƒÅmi
is significant herein.
S·πõjƒÅmi
cannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord‚Äôs form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore,
s·πõjƒÅmi
means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of the DvƒÅpara-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventh Manu in one day of BrahmƒÅ, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the
Vedas,
and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the
Vedas
makes one irreligious. In the
BhƒÅgavatam
it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The
Vedas
are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to BrahmƒÅ, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles of
dharma,
or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (
dharma·πÅ tu sƒÅk·π£ƒÅd bhagavat-pra·πáƒ´tam
). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The purpose of the
Vedas
is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ,
that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From the
BhƒÅgavatam
we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of K·πõ·π£·πáa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the
Vedas.
Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the
Vedas,
people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared in order to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every
avatƒÅra,
or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an
avatƒÅra
unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same ‚Äì to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.
The principles of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true in the beginner‚Äôs arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances."

According to
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
a
sƒÅdhu
(holy man) is a man in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a
sƒÅdhu.
And
du·π£k·πõtƒÅm
applies to those who do not care for K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Such miscreants, or
du·π£k·πõtƒÅm,
are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is accepted as a
sƒÅdhu,
even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons RƒÅva·πáa and Ka·πÅsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although PrahlƒÅda MahƒÅrƒÅja was the son of Hira·πáyaka≈õipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devakƒ´, the mother of K·πõ·π£·πáa, was the sister of Ka·πÅsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K·πõ·π£·πáa was to be born of them. So Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa appeared primarily to deliver Devakƒ´ rather than kill Ka·πÅsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.
In the
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
of K·πõ·π£·πáadƒÅsa KavirƒÅja, the following verses (
Madhya
20.263‚Äì264) summarize these principles of incarnation:

‚ÄúThe
avatƒÅra,
or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or
avatƒÅra.
Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name
avatƒÅra.
‚Äù
There are various kinds of
avatƒÅras,
such as
puru·π£ƒÅvatƒÅras, gu·πáƒÅvatƒÅras, lƒ´lƒÅvatƒÅras, ≈õakty-ƒÅve≈õa avatƒÅras, manvantara-avatƒÅras
and
yugƒÅvatƒÅras
‚Äì all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all
avatƒÅras.
Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa descends for the specific purpose of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V·πõndƒÅvana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K·πõ·π£·πáa
avatƒÅra
is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.
The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates that He incarnates also in the Age of Kali. As stated in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
the incarnation in the Age of Kali is Lord Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu, who spread the worship of K·πõ·π£·πáa by the
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana
movement (congregational chanting of the holy names) and spread K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana
would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the
Upani·π£ads, MahƒÅbhƒÅrata
and
BhƒÅgavatam.
The devotees of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa are very much attracted by the
sa·πÖkƒ´rtana
movement of Lord Caitanya. This
avatƒÅra
of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by His causeless mercy."

The Lord‚Äôs descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the sixth verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the
yogƒ´s
attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve ‚Äì merging into the impersonal
brahma-jyotir
of the Lord ‚Äì is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.33)
it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations:
advaitam acyutam anƒÅdim ananta-r≈´pam.
Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the
Vedas
(
Puru·π£a-bodhinƒ´ Upani·π£ad
):
eko devo nitya-lƒ´lƒÅnurakto
bhakta-vyƒÅpƒ´ h·πõdy antar-ƒÅtmƒÅ
‚ÄúThe one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees.‚Äù This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the
Vedas
and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version
tat tvam asi
is actually applied in this case. Anyone who understands Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, ‚ÄúYou are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead,‚Äù is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:
tam eva viditvƒÅti m·πõtyum eti
nƒÅnya·∏• panthƒÅ vidyate ‚ÄôyanƒÅya
‚ÄúOne can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there is no other way to achieve this perfection.‚Äù (
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
3.8) That there is no alternative means that anyone who does not understand Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance and consequently he will not attain salvation simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
according to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed-up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection."

As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of material consciousness: attachment to material life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called
bhƒÅva,
or transcendental love of Godhead.
According to
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
(1.4.15‚Äì16), the science of devotional service:

‚ÄúIn the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated. In the next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, which is matured in
bhƒÅva,
or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called
prema,
the highest perfectional stage of life.‚Äù In the
prema
stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one‚Äôs individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations that result in void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord."

Everyone is searching for K·πõ·π£·πáa in the different aspects of His manifestations. K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal
brahma-jyotir
effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K·πõ·π£·πáa is fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently, K·πõ·π£·πáa is the object of everyone‚Äôs realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one‚Äôs desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K·πõ·π£·πáa reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K·πõ·π£·πáa as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son and still another as his lover. K·πõ·π£·πáa rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K·πõ·π£·πáa helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the
yaj√±e≈õvara;
and those who are
yogƒ´s
seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the

There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God‚Äôs different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The

God is one.

The Supreme God is one ‚Äì K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (

pƒÅ·π£a·πá·∏çƒ´.
Even the great demigods like BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva (
≈õiva-viri√±ci-nutam
). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism.
Iha devatƒÅ·∏•
denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, Vi·π£·πáu, or K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even ≈örƒ´pƒÅda ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, or K·πõ·π£·πáa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (
h·πõta-j√±ƒÅna
) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or ‚Äúbig guns‚Äù in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worshiping empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity."

The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called
brƒÅhma·πáas
due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the
k·π£atriyas
due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the
vai≈õyas,
are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the
≈õ≈´dras,
or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, however, is above even the
brƒÅhma·πáas.
Although
brƒÅhma·πáas
by quality are supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a
brƒÅhma·πáa
and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, becomes a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness ‚Äì or, in other words, a Vai·π£·πáava. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K·πõ·π£·πáa, namely RƒÅma, N·πõsi·πÅha, VarƒÅha, etc. And as K·πõ·π£·πáa is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species."

As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic
sm·πõti
confirms this fact as follows:

‚ÄúIn the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature, by which the cosmic manifestation is made visible.‚Äù The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities. In the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
(2.1.34) it is confirmed,
vai·π£amya-nairgh·πõ·πáye na sƒÅpek·π£atvƒÅt:
the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity is responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of
karma,
or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of
karma.
One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reactions. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefited. Foolish persons or neophytes in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Arjuna‚Äôs desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Arjuna is here advised to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord‚Äôs previous disciples, such as the sun-god VivasvƒÅn, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before.

Action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of previous bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the fifteenth verse. Why such action should not be independent will be explained in the text to follow.
To act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter. The system of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ik·π£vƒÅku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness directly. Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.
It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself.
Dharma·πÅ tu sƒÅk·π£ƒÅd bhagavat-pra·πáƒ´tam
(
BhƒÅg.

). No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like BrahmƒÅ, ≈öiva, NƒÅrada, Manu, the KumƒÅras, Kapila, PrahlƒÅda, Bhƒ´·π£ma, ≈öukadeva GosvƒÅmƒ´, YamarƒÅja, Janaka and Bali MahƒÅrƒÅja. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence."

When the hand moves, it does not move out of its own accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desire for personal sense gratification. He moves exactly like a part of a machine. As a machine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, so a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the reactions of his endeavors. Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over his own body. A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his possession, yet the animal does not protest. Nor does it have any real independence. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, has very little time to falsely possess any material object.

A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible when one is fully in transcendental knowledge."

Becoming fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus his mind cannot be drawn from K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is the primeval Vi·π£·πáu. Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice aims at satisfying the Supreme Person, Vi·π£·πáu, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects."

How activities in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness as set forth here in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
This process is generally known as
yaj√±a,
or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Vi·π£·πáu, or K·πõ·π£·πáa. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, or for Vi·π£·πáu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The word
brahma
(Brahman) means ‚Äúspiritual.‚Äù The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called
brahma-jyotir,
His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that
brahma-jyotir,
but when the
jyotir
is covered by illusion (
mƒÅyƒÅ
) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor and the result are ‚Äì all combined together ‚Äì Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by
mƒÅyƒÅ
is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, it is said to be in
samƒÅdhi,
or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called
yaj√±a,
or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance and the result or ultimate gain ‚Äì everything ‚Äì becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

Some yogƒ´s perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.","Purport
As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is also called a perfect
yogƒ´
or a first-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factually sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi·π£·πáu, who is also known as Yaj√±a. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called
bahv-ƒ´≈õvara-vƒÅdƒ´,
or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self ‚Äì everything ‚Äì is sacrificed for K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus, he is the first-class
yogƒ´;
but he does not lose his individual existence."

are all meant to become perfect

brahmacƒÅrƒ´s,
or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. A
brahmacƒÅrƒ´
hears only words concerning K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure
brahmacƒÅrƒ´
engages fully in
harer nƒÅmƒÅnukƒ´rtanam
‚Äì chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of
yaj√±a
because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life."

The
yoga
system conceived by Pata√±jali is referred to herein. In the
Yoga-s≈´tra
of Pata√±jali, the soul is called
pratyag-ƒÅtmƒÅ
and
parƒÅg-ƒÅtmƒÅ.
As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called
parƒÅg-ƒÅtmƒÅ,
but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called
pratyag-ƒÅtmƒÅ.
The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Pata√±jali system of
yoga
instructs one on how to control the functions of the body‚Äôs air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this
yoga
system,
pratyag-ƒÅtmƒÅ
is the ultimate goal. This
pratyag-ƒÅtmƒÅ
is withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, and hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the
prƒÅ·πáa-vƒÅyu.
The
apƒÅna-vƒÅyu
goes downwards,
vyƒÅna-vƒÅyu
acts to shrink and expand,
samƒÅna-vƒÅyu

Having accepted strict vows, some become enlightened by sacrificing their possessions, and others by performing severe austerities, by practicing the yoga of eightfold mysticism, or by studying the Vedas to advance in transcendental knowledge.","Purport
These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like
dharma-≈õƒÅlƒÅ, anna-k·π£etra, atithi-≈õƒÅlƒÅ, anƒÅthƒÅlaya
and
vidyƒÅ-pƒ´·π≠ha.
In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called
dravyamaya-yaj√±a.
There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as
candrƒÅya·πáa
and
cƒÅturmƒÅsya.
These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the
cƒÅturmƒÅsya
vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called
tapomaya-yaj√±a.
There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic
yogas
like the Pata√±jali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or
ha·π≠ha-yoga
or
a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga
(for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called
yoga-yaj√±a,
sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the
Upani·π£ads
and
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tras,
or the SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy. All of these are called
svƒÅdhyƒÅya-yaj√±a,
or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these
yogƒ´s
are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, however, is different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifice but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotees. Therefore, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is transcendental."

This system of
yoga
for controlling the breathing process is called
prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma,
and in the beginning it is practiced in the
ha·π≠ha-yoga
system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the airs within the body so as to reverse the directions of their passage. The
apƒÅna
air goes downward, and the
prƒÅ·πáa
air goes up. The
prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma-yogƒ´
practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into
p≈´raka,
equilibrium. Offering the exhaled breath into the inhaled breath is called
recaka.
When both air currents are completely stopped, one is said to be in
kumbhaka-yoga.
By practice of
kumbhaka-yoga,
one can increase the duration of life for perfection in spiritual realization. The intelligent
yogƒ´
is interested in attaining perfection in one life, without waiting for the next. For by practicing
kumbhaka-yoga,
the
yogƒ´s
increase the duration of life by many, many years. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation, as stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ

k·πõ·π£·πáa-prasƒÅdam,
or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement."

This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, not only does one become happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa."

O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?","Purport
Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one‚Äôs dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The
Vedas,
therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance of
yaj√±a
we can have enough food, enough milk, etc. ‚Äì even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The
Vedas
prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of
yaj√±a
(sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform
yaj√±a
according to the
Vedas,
how can he expect a happy life even in this body, and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of
yaj√±a.
But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. A life of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence."

Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one‚Äôs faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities.

The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The
BhƒÅgavatam
(6.3.19)
says,
dharma·πÅ tu sƒÅk·π£ƒÅd bhagavat-pra·πáƒ´tam:
the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect."

Having obtained real knowledge from a self-realized soul, you will never fall again into such illusion, for by this knowledge you will see that all living beings are but part of the Supreme, or, in other words, that they are Mine.","Purport
The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. The sense of an existence separate from K·πõ·π£·πáa is called
mƒÅyƒÅ
(
mƒÅ
‚Äì not,
yƒÅ
‚Äì this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K·πõ·π£·πáa, that K·πõ·π£·πáa is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
it is clearly stated that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophers wrongly think that K·πõ·π£·πáa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophers fail to understand that
absolute
means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.
For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K·πõ·π£·πáa. Although we are separated parts of K·πõ·π£·πáa, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is
mƒÅyƒÅ,
or not actual fact. We are all meant to satisfy K·πõ·π£·πáa. By
mƒÅyƒÅ
alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. The whole teaching of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is targeted toward this end: that a living being, as K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs eternal servitor, cannot be separated from K·πõ·π£·πáa, and his sense of being an identity apart from K·πõ·π£·πáa is called
mƒÅyƒÅ.
The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose since time immemorial, they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K·πõ·π£·πáa. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K·πõ·π£·πáa. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the
BhƒÅgavatam

:

This material world is sometimes regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the ocean, however expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe. If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation. The boat of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime."

Perfect knowledge of self and Superself and of their relationship is compared herein to fire. This fire not only burns up all reactions to impious activities, but also all reactions to pious activities, turning them to ashes. There are many stages of reaction: reaction in the making, reaction fructifying, reaction already achieved, and reaction
a priori.
But knowledge of the constitutional position of the living entity burns everything to ashes. When one is in complete knowledge, all reactions, both

When we speak of transcendental knowledge, we do so in terms of spiritual understanding. As such, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge.

The
yoga
system instructed in this chapter is called
sanƒÅtana-yoga,
or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This
yoga
has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one‚Äôs material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one‚Äôs material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one‚Äôs own self (or one‚Äôs constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying the
Vedas
and in partaking of the social institution called
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama-dharma
. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
but one who doubts the authority of K·πõ·π£·πáa falls back. One is therefore advised to study
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
as it is expressed in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ

In this Fifth Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by
buddhi-yoga,
or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K·πõ·π£·πáa has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that
sannyƒÅsa,
or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge."

Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually.
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(5.5.4‚Äì6) confirms this as follows:

‚ÄúPeople are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one‚Äôs fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about his real identity. As long as he does not know his real identity, he has to work for fruitive results for sense gratification, and as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to VƒÅsudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence.‚Äù
Therefore,
j√±ƒÅna
(or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to
act
in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one‚Äôs advancement in real knowledge. Without K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ in his
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu

‚ÄúWhen persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete.‚Äù Renunciation is complete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K·πõ·π£·πáa, everything should be employed in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. This perfect form of action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a

of the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ school."

One who is fully in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions. Such a renouncer, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. He knows fully well that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the whole and that he is part and parcel of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with K·πõ·π£·πáa is incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to or lament over. There is no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for K·πõ·π£·πáa. Being thus freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated ‚Äì even in this material world."

The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence. The soul of the material world is Vi·π£·πáu, or the Supersoul. Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the root of the tree, and the other is to water the root. The real student of SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Vi·π£·πáu, and then, in perfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Vi·π£·πáu. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of SƒÅ·πÖkhya and

The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process, SƒÅ·πÖkhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional
yoga
process one has to attach himself to the work of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment.

sannyƒÅsƒ´s
have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vai·π£·πáava

have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´
sannyƒÅsƒ´s,

One who is on the path of liberation by K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is very dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from K·πõ·π£·πáa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on K·πõ·π£·πáa, there is no chance of his being deviated from K·πõ·π£·πáa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to K·πõ·π£·πáa; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K·πõ·π£·πáa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, ‚ÄúWhy then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn‚Äôt he in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness?‚Äù Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K·πõ·π£·πáa, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of K·πõ·π£·πáa in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work."

The difference between a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and a person in bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to K·πõ·π£·πáa whereas the latter is attached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached to K·πõ·π£·πáa and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he has no anxiety over the results of his work. In the
BhƒÅgavatam,
the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being one‚Äôs functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs energy, and K·πõ·π£·πáa is all good. Therefore, activities in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is therefore filled with peace in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. But one who is entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness ‚Äì realization that there is no existence besides K·πõ·π£·πáa is the platform of peace and fearlessness."

When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither working nor causing work to be done.","Purport
The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by its particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers. By K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are mentioned as follows:

The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.","Purport
The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one of the energies or natures of the Supreme Lord but is distinct from matter, which is another nature ‚Äì called inferior ‚Äì of the Lord. Somehow the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of the body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil."

Nor does the Supreme Lord assume anyone‚Äôs sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.","Purport
The Sanskrit word
vibhu
means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is
vibhu,
or omniscient, but the living entity is
a·πáu,
or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desires K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare,
e·π£a u hy eva sƒÅdhu karma kƒÅrayati ta·πÅ yam ebhyo lokebhya unninƒ´·π£ate. e·π£a u evƒÅsƒÅdhu karma kƒÅrayati yam adho ninƒ´·π£ate:
‚ÄúThe Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so that he may go to hell.‚Äù (

‚ÄúThe living entity is completely dependent in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air.‚Äù
Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tras
(2.1.34) also confirm this.

Those who have forgotten K·πõ·π£·πáa must certainly be bewildered, but those who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the

and
na hi j√±ƒÅnena sad·πõ≈õam.
Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K·πõ·π£·πáa, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, nineteenth verse:
bah≈´nƒÅ·πÅ janmanƒÅm ante j√±ƒÅnavƒÅn mƒÅ·πÅ prapadyate.
After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K·πõ·π£·πáa, or when one attains K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is, for K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one‚Äôs relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge."

The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. The whole
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
centers around the declaration that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature.
Para-tattva
means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and BhagavƒÅn. BhagavƒÅn, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than that. The Lord says,
matta·∏• paratara·πÅ nƒÅnyat ki√±cid asti dhana√±-jaya.
Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K·πõ·π£·πáa:
brahma·πáo hi prati·π£·π≠hƒÅham.
Therefore in all ways K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in K·πõ·π£·πáa, or, in other words, one who is fully in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in K·πõ·π£·πáa, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation."

A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes. The
brƒÅhma·πáa
and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a cow and an elephant may be different from the point of view of species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, is present in everyone‚Äôs heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is present both in the outcaste and in the
brƒÅhma·πáa,
although the body of a
brƒÅhma·πáa
and that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is present in each and every body. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction."

He is therefore not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to his body. This steadiness of mind is called
sthira-buddhi,
or self-intelligence. He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul. This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and BhagavƒÅn. He thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one with the Supreme in all respects. This is called Brahman realization, or self-realization.

Similarly, the devotee in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, although far away from the Lord‚Äôs abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly ‚Äì by engagement in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called
brahma-nirvƒÅ·πáa,
or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme."

A person in full consciousness of Me, knowing Me to be the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains peace from the pangs of material miseries.","Purport
The conditioned souls within the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord ≈öiva and Lord BrahmƒÅ. In the
Vedas
(
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
6.7) the Supreme Lord is described as
tam ƒ´≈õvarƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πÅ parama·πÅ mahe≈õvara·πÅ.
Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness: Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, generally known as
karma-yoga.
The question of mental speculation as to how
karma-yoga
can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is
bhakti-yoga,
and
j√±ƒÅna-yoga
is a path leading to
bhakti-yoga.
K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one‚Äôs relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with
mƒÅyƒÅ
(illusion) due to the desire to lord it over
mƒÅyƒÅ,
and that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one‚Äôs practical performance of duties in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, which helps one control the senses in every respect and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And one who stands fast in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, controlling the abovementioned passions, remains factually in the transcendental stage, or
brahma-nirvƒÅ·πáa.
The eightfold
yoga
mysticism is automatically practiced in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is a gradual process of elevation in the practice of
yama, niyama, ƒÅsana, prƒÅ·πáƒÅyƒÅma, pratyƒÅhƒÅra, dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ, dhyƒÅna
and
samƒÅdhi.
But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of
Karma-yoga,
or Action in K·πõ·π£·πáa Consciousness."

In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold
yoga
system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age of Kali. Although the eightfold
yoga
system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of
karma-yoga,
or acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect
sannyƒÅsƒ´,
the perfect
yogƒ´.
The
sannyƒÅsƒ´s
sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform
agnihotra yaj√±as
(fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is to become one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic
yogƒ´
who practices the
yoga
system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus he is the perfect
sannyƒÅsƒ´,
or perfect
yogƒ´.
Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:
na dhana·πÅ na jana·πÅ na sundarƒ´·πÅ

What is called renunciation you should know to be the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, O son of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu, for one can never become a yogƒ´ unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.","Purport
Real
sannyƒÅsa-yoga
or
bhakti
means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the
yogƒ´s
who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is simultaneously a
sannyƒÅsƒ´
and a
yogƒ´.
The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the
j√±ƒÅna
and
yoga
processes, is automatically served in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then
j√±ƒÅna
and
yoga
are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called
yoga.
It may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called
yoga
and may be divided into three parts, namely
j√±ƒÅna-yoga, dhyƒÅna-yoga
and
bhakti-yoga.
The beginning of the ladder is called the
yogƒÅruruk·π£u
stage, and the highest rung is called
yogƒÅr≈´·∏çha.
Concerning the eightfold
yoga
system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.
A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person, however, is situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of K·πõ·π£·πáa. And, being constantly engaged in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa, he is considered to have ceased all material activities."

When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the

The word

denotes body, mind and soul ‚Äì depending upon different circumstances. In the
yoga
system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of
yoga
practice,
ƒÅtmƒÅ
refers here to the mind. The purpose of the
yoga
system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The word
hi
is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one
must
do this. It is also said:

The purpose of practicing eightfold

is to control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of
yoga
(for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one‚Äôs mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. Real
yoga
practice entails meeting the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ within the heart and then following His dictation. For one who takes to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness directly, perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically."

Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone‚Äôs heart as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. When the mind is misled by the external, illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one‚Äôs mind is controlled through one of the
yoga
systems, one should be considered to have already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one‚Äôs mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical
samƒÅdhi,

K·πõ·π£·πáa is realized in different degrees as Brahman, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, because the impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K·πõ·π£·πáa and the Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. A directly K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative
yogƒ´
are imperfectly K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious.
Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K·πõ·π£·πáa. One should always think of K·πõ·π£·πáa and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called
samƒÅdhi,
or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.
All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, because direct K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ characterizes K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in this way:

‚ÄúWhen one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K·πõ·π£·πáa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K·πõ·π£·πáa is not as complete in his renunciation.‚Äù (
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
1.2.255‚Äì256)
A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person well knows that everything belongs to K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Therefore a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the perfect
yogƒ´."

The ultimate goal in practicing
yoga
is now clearly explained.
Yoga
practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no
yogƒ´
according to
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
Nor does cessation of material existence entail one‚Äôs entering into ‚Äúthe void,‚Äù which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
as that place where there is no need of sun, moon or electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called
para·πÅ dhƒÅma,
or superior abodes.
A consummate
yogƒ´,
who is perfect in understanding Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, as is clearly stated herein by the Lord Himself (
mat-citta·∏•, mat-para·∏•, mat-sthƒÅnam
), can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, K·πõ·π£·πáaloka, known as Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.37)
it is clearly stated,
goloka eva nivasaty akhilƒÅtma-bh≈´ta·∏•:
the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky (Vaiku·πá·π≠ha) or enter into the Lord‚Äôs eternal abode (Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana) without the proper understanding of K·πõ·π£·πáa and His plenary expansion Vi·π£·πáu. Therefore a person working in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the perfect
yogƒ´,
because his mind is always absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs activities (
sa vai mana·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa-padƒÅravindayo·∏•

Vedas
also (

‚ÄúOne can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù In other words, perfection of the
yoga
system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people."

Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the
yogƒ´s.
Too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together. There is no need for men to eat animals, because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things.
Bhu√±jate te tv agha·πÅ pƒÅpƒÅ ye pacanty ƒÅtma-kƒÅra·πáƒÅt.
Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to K·πõ·π£·πáa, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect
yoga.
It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa. A person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, only the K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person can attain perfection in
yoga
practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice
yoga.
The K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform
yoga
practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot perform
yoga."

He who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.","Purport
Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating ‚Äì which are demands of the body ‚Äì can block advancement in the practice of
yoga.
As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept
prasƒÅdam,
sanctified food. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is offered, according to the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(9.26)
, vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss.
Avyartha-kƒÅlatvam:
a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect is ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´, who was always engaged in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that. ·π¨hƒÅkura HaridƒÅsa would not even accept
prasƒÅdam
nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him."

‚ÄúKing Ambarƒ´·π£a first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flowers offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the
tulasƒ´
leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee.‚Äù
This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of MahƒÅrƒÅja Ambarƒ´·π£a. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called
arcana,
or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general ‚Äì especially those who are not in the renounced order of life ‚Äì transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called
yukta

Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ."

As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu·∏ça, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi·π£·πáu, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu·∏ça was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu·∏ça at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu·∏ça.
Similarly, the practice of
yoga,
especially
bhakti-yoga
in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves."

The Lord in His ParamƒÅtmƒÅ feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a

knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a
brƒÅhma·πáa
. That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of
yoga
cannot see so clearly. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person can see K·πõ·π£·πáa in the heart of both the believer and the nonbeliever. In the
sm·πõti
this is confirmed as follows:
ƒÅtatatvƒÅc ca mƒÅt·πõtvƒÅc ca ƒÅtmƒÅ hi paramo hari·∏•.
The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the supreme father (or mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.
Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies ‚Äì the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord‚Äôs energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another.
The
yogƒ´
sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in the spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

A person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness certainly sees Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa everywhere, and he sees everything in K·πõ·π£·πáa. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K·πõ·π£·πáa, knowing that everything is a manifestation of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs energy. Nothing can exist without K·πõ·π£·πáa, and K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Lord of everything ‚Äì this is the basic principle of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the development of love of K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì a position transcendental even to material liberation. At this stage of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, beyond self-realization, the devotee becomes one with K·πõ·π£·πáa in the sense that K·πõ·π£·πáa becomes everything for the devotee and the devotee becomes full in loving K·πõ·π£·πáa. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity can never be annihilated, nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K·πõ·π£·πáa is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.38)
:

At this stage, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a
yogƒ´
who sees the Lord as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ within the heart, the same applies. Such a

A
yogƒ´
who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the plenary portion of K·πõ·π£·πáa as Vi·π£·πáu ‚Äì with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower. The
yogƒ´
should know that Vi·π£·πáu is not different from K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone‚Äôs heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of K·πõ·π£·πáa and a perfect
yogƒ´
engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The
yogƒ´
in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness ‚Äì even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence ‚Äì remains always situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is confirmed in the
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
(1.2.187) of ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´:
nikhilƒÅsv apy avasthƒÅsu jƒ´van-mukta·∏• sa ucyate.
A devotee of the Lord, always acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is automatically liberated. In the

‚ÄúBy concentrating one‚Äôs attention on the transcendental form of K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him.‚Äù
K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice. This very understanding that K·πõ·π£·πáa is present as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ in everyone‚Äôs heart makes the
yogƒ´
faultless. The
Vedas
(
GopƒÅla-tƒÅpanƒ´ Upani·π£ad

One who is K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious is a perfect

he is aware of everyone‚Äôs happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience. The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing K·πõ·π£·πáa to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being, the proprietor of all lands and planets, and the sincerest friend of all living entities. The perfect
yogƒ´
knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. And because one in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa everywhere. Since the perfect

yoga
system, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of
yoga,
even though he was favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of
yoga.
In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this Age of Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this
yoga
system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are certainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired goal."

The more one hears about K·πõ·π£·πáa, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from K·πõ·π£·πáa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn
vairƒÅgya. VairƒÅgya
means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is practical because by hearing about K·πõ·π£·πáa one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called
pare≈õƒÅnubhava,
spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice
yoga
while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.
Yoga
practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show of
yoga
may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, one must control the mind by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person easily achieves the result of
yoga
practice without separate endeavor, but a
yoga
practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious."

Arjuna said: O K·πõ·π£·πáa, what is the destination of the unsuccessful transcendentalist, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization with faith but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?","Purport
The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or by
bhakti-yoga.
In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of
bhakti-yoga
is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold
yoga
system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons. First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called
yogƒÅc calita-mƒÅnasa·∏•:
deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization."

O mighty-armed K·πõ·π£·πáa, does not such a man, who is bewildered from the path of transcendence, fall away from both spiritual and material success and perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?","Purport
There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest in transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work. When one takes to the path of transcendence, one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness. If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The
brahma·πáa·∏• pathi
is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, who is manifested as Brahman, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and BhagavƒÅn. Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme Person is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through Brahman and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ realization takes many, many births (
bah≈´nƒÅ·πÅ janmanƒÅm ante
). Therefore the supermost path of transcendental realization is
bhakti-yoga,
or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the direct method."

K·πõ·π£·πáa is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Lord said that all living entities existed individually in the past, they exist now in the present, and they continue to retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material entanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above K·πõ·π£·πáa, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of K·πõ·π£·πáa is the final and complete answer to all doubts, because He knows past, present and future perfectly ‚Äì but no one knows Him. K·πõ·π£·πáa and K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious devotees alone can know what is what."

‚ÄúIf someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything.‚Äù For material prospects there are many activities, both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One may argue that by K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction for not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The
BhƒÅgavatam
assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be subjected to the reaction for not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
The purport may be understood as follows. Humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious, because while enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions, and who thus rise gradually to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, certainly progress in life.
Those who are following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely (1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, (2) those who are trying to find ultimate liberation from material existence, and (3) those who are devotees in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life ‚Äì even to the higher planets ‚Äì but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold
yoga
system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation."

The famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted ·π¨hƒÅkura HaridƒÅsa as one of His most important disciples. Although ·π¨hƒÅkura HaridƒÅsa happened to take his birth in a Muslim family, he was elevated to the post of
nƒÅmƒÅcƒÅrya

Vedas,
known as
≈õabda-brahma.

yogas,
as will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of
yoga,
but He has not mentioned that it is better than
bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga
is full spiritual knowledge, and therefore nothing can excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work without K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form of

The word
bhajate
is significant here.
Bhajate
has its root in the verb
bhaj,
which is used when there is need of service. The English word ‚Äúworship‚Äù cannot be used in the same sense as
bhaj.
Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The
BhƒÅgavatam
(11.5.3)
confirms this as follows:
ya e·π£ƒÅ·πÅ puru·π£a·πÅ sƒÅk·π£ƒÅd

‚ÄúAnyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position.‚Äù
In this verse also the word
bhajanti
is used. Therefore,
bhajanti
is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word ‚Äúworship‚Äù can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word
avajƒÅnanti,
used in this verse of
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
is also found in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. AvajƒÅnanti mƒÅ·πÅ m≈´·∏çhƒÅ·∏•:
‚ÄúOnly the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word
bhajanti
and the word ‚Äúworship.‚Äù
The culmination of all kinds of
yoga
practices lies in
bhakti yoga.
All other
yogas
are but means to come to the point of
bhakti
in
bhakti-yoga. Yoga
actually means
bhakti-yoga;
all other
yogas
are progressions toward the destination of
bhakti-yoga.
From the beginning of
karma-yoga
to the end of
bhakti-yoga
is a long way to self-realization.
Karma-yoga,
without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When
karma-yoga
increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called
j√±ƒÅna-yoga.
When
j√±ƒÅna-yoga
increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called
a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga.
And when one surpasses the
a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga
and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K·πõ·π£·πáa, it is called
bhakti-yoga,
the culmination. Factually,
bhakti-yoga
is the ultimate goal, but to analyze
bhakti-yoga
minutely one has to understand these other
yogas.
The
yogƒ´
who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name:
karma-yogƒ´, j√±ƒÅna-yogƒ´
or
dhyƒÅna-yogƒ´, rƒÅja-yogƒ´, ha·π≠ha-yogƒ´,
etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of
bhakti-yoga,
it is to be understood that he has surpassed all other
yogas.
Therefore, to become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious is the highest stage of
yoga,
just as, when we speak of HimƒÅlayan, we refer to the world‚Äôs highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.
It is by great fortune that one comes to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness on the path of
bhakti-yoga
to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal
yogƒ´
concentrates his attention on K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is called ≈öyƒÅmasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotuslike face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels, and whose body is flower-garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the
brahma-jyotir.
He incarnates in different forms such as RƒÅma, N·πõsi·πÅha, VarƒÅha and K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of mother Ya≈õodƒÅ, and He is known as K·πõ·π£·πáa, Govinda and VƒÅsudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest
yogƒ´.
This stage of highest perfection in
yoga
can be attained only by
bhakti-yoga,
as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:
yasya deve parƒÅ bhaktir
yathƒÅ deve tathƒÅ gurau
tasyaite kathitƒÅ hy arthƒÅ·∏•

‚Äú
Bhakti

nai·π£karmya.
‚Äù (

These are some of the means for performance of
bhakti,
or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the
yoga
system.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Now hear, O son of P·πõthƒÅ, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.","Purport
In this Seventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the nature of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is fully described. K·πõ·π£·πáa is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to K·πõ·π£·πáa and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K·πõ·π£·πáa are described in this chapter.
In the first six chapters of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of
yogas.
At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K·πõ·π£·πáa, or in other words K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is the highest form of all
yoga.
By concentrating one‚Äôs mind upon K·πõ·π£·πáa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise. Impersonal
brahma-jyotir
or localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth, because it is partial. Full and scientific knowledge is K·πõ·π£·πáa, and everything is revealed to the person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. In complete K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness one knows that K·πõ·π£·πáa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of
yoga
are only steppingstones on the path of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One who takes directly to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness automatically knows about
brahma-jyotir
and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ in full. By practice of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness
yoga,
one can know everything in full ‚Äì namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.
One should therefore begin
yoga
practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K·πõ·π£·πáa the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which
≈õrava·πáam
is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna,
tac ch·πõ·πáu,
or ‚ÄúHear from Me.‚Äù No one can be a greater authority than K·πõ·π£·πáa, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity to become a perfectly K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person. One has therefore to learn from K·πõ·π£·πáa directly or from a pure devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.
In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
this process of understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:

‚ÄúTo hear about K·πõ·π£·πáa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about K·πõ·π£·πáa, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is dwelling in everyone‚Äôs heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K·πõ·π£·πáa from the
BhƒÅgavatam
and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly. Thus
bhakti-yoga
severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of
asa·πÅ≈õaya·πÅ samagram,
understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead.‚Äù (
BhƒÅg.
1.2.17‚Äì21) Therefore only by hearing from K·πõ·π£·πáa or from His devotee in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness can one understand the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa."

Complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world, the spirit behind it, and the source of both of them. This is transcendental knowledge. The Lord wants to explain the above-mentioned system of knowledge because Arjuna is K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs confidential devotee and friend. In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord in disciplic succession directly from the Lord. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of
yoga
practice. When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown. The

Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.","Purport
There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by
j√±ƒÅna-yoga, dhyƒÅna-yoga
and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K·πõ·π£·πáa can be known only by persons who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. The
yogƒ´s
and
j√±ƒÅnƒ´s
are confused in their attempts to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, ≈örƒ´pƒÅda ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya, has admitted in his
Gƒ´tƒÅ
commentary that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept K·πõ·π£·πáa as such, for it is very difficult to know K·πõ·π£·πáa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.
K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda.

It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of
bhakti,
or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of
bhakti
is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of
bhakti
is not easy. The so-called path of
bhakti
practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of
bhakti
may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ writes in his
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu

‚ÄúDevotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the

It is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ-realized
yogƒ´
to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Ya≈õodƒÅ or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K·πõ·π£·πáa (
muhyanti yat s≈´raya·∏•

‚ÄúNo one knows Me as I am,‚Äù the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then

‚ÄúSuch a great soul is very rare.‚Äù Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know K·πõ·π£·πáa as He is (

Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation ‚Äì because K·πõ·π£·πáa is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:

The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies. Material nature is called
prak·πõti,
or the energy of the Lord in His different
puru·π£a
incarnations (expansions) as described in the
NƒÅrada Pa√±carƒÅtra,
one of the
SƒÅtvata-tantras:

‚ÄúFor material creation, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs plenary expansion assumes three Vi·π£·πáus. The first one, MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu, creates the total material energy, known as the
mahat-tattva.
The second, Garbhodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K·π£ƒ´rodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. He is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi·π£·πáus can be liberated from material entanglement.‚Äù
This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Vi·π£·πáu expansions of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. These
puru·π£as
are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K·πõ·π£·πáa) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the
puru·π£as
‚Äì the causes, controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original cause of the material manifestation.
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the
brahma-jyotir,
which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in the
brahma-jyotir
as there are in the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha-lokas, and the impersonalist accepts this
brahma-jyotir
as the ultimate eternal goal. The ParamƒÅtmƒÅ manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the K·π£ƒ´rodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu. The ParamƒÅtmƒÅ manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.
In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The false ego ‚Äì ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt is mine,‚Äù which constitute the basic principle of material existence ‚Äì includes ten sense organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the
mahat-tattva.
Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of SƒÅ·πÖkhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K·πõ·π£·πáa as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K·πõ·π£·πáa, as it is described in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ."

Besides these, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is another, superior energy of Mine, which comprises the living entities who are exploiting the resources of this material, inferior nature.","Purport
Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore the living entities are always controlled by the Lord ‚Äì they have no independent existence. They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(10.87.30)
as follows:
aparimitƒÅ dhruvƒÅs tanu-bh·πõto yadi sarva-gatƒÅs
tarhi na ≈õƒÅsyateti niyamo dhruva netarathƒÅ
ajani ca yan-maya·πÅ tad avimucya niyant·πõ bhavet
samam anujƒÅnatƒÅ·πÅ yad amata·πÅ mata-du·π£·π≠atayƒÅ
‚ÄúO Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually guided by a faulty and polluted opinion.‚Äù
The Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called
mukti,
or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, ‚ÄúI am matter, and material acquisitions are mine.‚Äù His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may conclude that the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K·πõ·π£·πáa; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, or liberated."

Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy, spirit soul, is present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Vi·π£·πáu. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the living entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big city, but he cannot be the cause of a big universe. The cause of the big universe is the big soul, or the Supersoul. And K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme, is the cause of both the big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes.

There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ: ƒ´≈õvara·∏• parama·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa·∏• sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraha·∏•;
that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
(3.10):
tato yad uttara-tara·πÅ tad ar≈´pam anƒÅmayam/ ya etad vidur am·πõtƒÅs te bhavanti athetare du·∏•kham evƒÅpiyanti.
‚ÄúIn the material world BrahmƒÅ, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond BrahmƒÅ there is the Transcendence, who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world.‚Äù
The impersonalist puts more stress on the word
ar≈´pam.
But this
ar≈´pam
is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
quoted above. Other verses in the
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
(3.8‚Äì9) substantiate this as follows:

‚ÄúI know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person.
‚ÄúThere is no truth superior to that Supreme Person, because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies.‚Äù
From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual."

This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man‚Äôs thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine:
acintya bheda
- and
abheda-tattva
‚Äì simultaneous oneness and difference.
The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the
brahma-jyotir,
which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. And
pra·πáava,
or the
o·πÅ-kƒÅra
transcendental sound in the beginning of every Vedic hymn, addresses the Supreme Lord. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound
o·πÅ-kƒÅra.
But they do not realize that
o·πÅ-kƒÅra
is the sound representation of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The jurisdiction of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know K·πõ·π£·πáa are in illusion, and so knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage."

The duration of man‚Äôs life is also due to K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore by the grace of K·πõ·π£·πáa, man can prolong his life or diminish it. So K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is active in every sphere."

means seed; K·πõ·π£·πáa is the seed of everything. There are various living entities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert ‚Äì they cannot move, but only stand. Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them are moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their life is K·πõ·π£·πáa. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is that from which everything is emanating. K·πõ·π£·πáa is Para-brahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Para-brahman is personal. Impersonal Brahman is situated in the personal aspect ‚Äì that is stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
. Therefore, originally, K·πõ·π£·πáa is the source of everything. He is the root. As the root of a tree maintains the whole tree, K·πõ·π£·πáa, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. This is also confirmed in the Vedic literature (
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad

nityo nityƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ cetana≈õ cetanƒÅnƒÅm

He is the prime eternal among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. One cannot do anything without intelligence, and K·πõ·π£·πáa also says that He is the root of all intelligence.

The whole world is enchanted by the three modes of material nature. Those who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa.
Every living entity under the influence of material nature has a particular type of body and a particular type of psychological and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called
brƒÅhma·πáas.
Those who are purely in the mode of passion are called
k·π£atriyas.
Those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called
vai≈õyas.
Those who are completely in ignorance are called

And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However, these designations are not permanent. I may be either a
brƒÅhma·πáa, k·π£atriya, vai≈õya
or whatever ‚Äì in any case, this life is temporary.

brƒÅhma·πáa,
Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is behind all these modes. So Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa says that living entities deluded by these three modes of nature do not understand that behind the material background is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
There are many different kinds of living entities ‚Äì human beings, demigods, animals, etc. ‚Äì and each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance? K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are truly established in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are actually liberated."

This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.","Purport
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called
nitya-baddha,
or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The
Vedas
confirm this as follows:
mƒÅyƒÅ·πÅ tu prak·πõti·πÅ vidyƒÅn mƒÅyina·πÅ tu mahe≈õvaram.
‚ÄúAlthough
mƒÅyƒÅ
[illusion] is false or temporary, the background of
mƒÅyƒÅ
is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe≈õvara, the supreme controller.‚Äù (
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
4.10)
Another meaning of
gu·πáa
is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself ‚Äì he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, can help one gain such release. K·πõ·π£·πáa, being the Lord of the illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity, who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.
The words
mƒÅm eva
are also significant.
MƒÅm
means unto K·πõ·π£·πáa (Vi·π£·πáu) only, and not BrahmƒÅ or ≈öiva. Although BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi·π£·πáu, it is not possible for such incarnations of
rajo-gu·πáa
(passion) and
tamo-gu·πáa
(ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of
mƒÅyƒÅ.
In other words, both BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva are also under the influence of
mƒÅyƒÅ.
Only Vi·π£·πáu is the master of
mƒÅyƒÅ;
therefore He alone can give release to the conditioned soul. The
Vedas
(
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
3.8) confirm this in the phrase
tam eva viditvƒÅ,
or ‚ÄúFreedom is possible only by understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù Even Lord ≈öiva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi·π£·πáu. Lord ≈öiva says,

It is said in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K·πõ·π£·πáa one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead?
Mukti,
or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don‚Äôt these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?
The
Gƒ´tƒÅ
answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like BrahmƒÅ, ≈öiva, Kapila, the KumƒÅras, Manu, VyƒÅsa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, PrahlƒÅda, Bali, and later on MadhvƒÅcƒÅrya, RƒÅmƒÅnujƒÅcƒÅrya, ≈örƒ´ Caitanya and many others ‚Äì who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc. ‚Äì surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of ‚Äúplanning commissions.‚Äù
The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word
du·π£k·πõtina·∏•,
or ‚Äúmiscreants.‚Äù
K·πõtƒ´
means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist‚Äôs brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called
du·π£k·πõtƒ´,
which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.
In the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hira·πáyaka≈õipu and RƒÅva·πáa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These
du·π£k·πõtinas,
or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below.
(1) The
m≈´·∏çhas
are those who are grossly foolish, like hardworking beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying sound only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that
karma
(action) is meant for
yaj√±a
(sacrifice).
Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such
m≈´·∏çhas,
material gains, which are destructible, are life‚Äôs all in all ‚Äì despite the fact that the
m≈´·∏çhas
enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the night soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane world, but will have very little time to hear about the eternal living force that moves the material world.
(2) Another class of
du·π£k·πõtƒ´,
or miscreant, is called the
narƒÅdhama,
or the lowest of mankind.
Nara
means human being, and
adhama
means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulative principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed but who have no religious principles must be considered
narƒÅdhamas.
Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man‚Äôs relation with Him. In the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The civilized form of human life is meant for man‚Äôs
reviving the lost consciousness
of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a
narƒÅdhama.
We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother‚Äôs womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by
mƒÅyƒÅ,
the illusory energy.
It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the
Manu-sm·πõti,
which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of
var·πáƒÅ≈õrama.
However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is
narƒÅdhama.
When the whole population becomes
narƒÅdhama,
naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ,
a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned
brƒÅhma·πáa,
the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. ≈örƒ´ NityƒÅnanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical
narƒÅdhamas,
the brothers JagƒÅi and MƒÅdhƒÅi, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the
narƒÅdhama
who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.
≈örƒ´ Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu, in propagating the
bhƒÅgavata-dharma,
or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even refuse to give an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord?
NarƒÅdhamas,
or the lowest of mankind, willfully neglect the prime duty of the human being.
(3) The next class of
du·π£k·πõtƒ´
is called
mƒÅyayƒÅpah·πõta-j√±ƒÅnƒÅ·∏•,
or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy. They are mostly very learned fellows ‚Äì great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc. ‚Äì but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.
There are a great number of
mƒÅyayƒÅpah·πõta-j√±ƒÅnƒÅ·∏•
at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
In the
Gƒ´tƒÅ,
in plain and simple language, it is stated that ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of BrahmƒÅ, the original father of all human beings. In fact, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is said to be not only the father of BrahmƒÅ but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the
mƒÅyayƒÅpah·πõta-j√±ƒÅnƒÅ·∏•
deride the personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.
All the unauthorized interpretations of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
by the class of
mƒÅyayƒÅpah·πõta-j√±ƒÅnƒÅ·∏•,
outside the purview of the
paramparƒÅ
system, are so many stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.
(4) The last class of
du·π£k·πõtƒ´
is called
ƒÅsura·πÅ bhƒÅvam ƒÅ≈õritƒÅ·∏•,
or those of demonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons, whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead, cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa.
≈örƒ´ YƒÅmunƒÅcƒÅrya ƒÄlabandaru of South India said, ‚ÄúO my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles, despite Your uncommon qualities, features and activities, despite Your personality‚Äôs being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities.‚Äù
Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice."

Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, and they are called
su-k·πõtina·∏•,
or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men ‚Äì those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees, because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit. The
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
(1.1.11) defines pure devotion thus:
anyƒÅbhilƒÅ·π£itƒÅ-≈õ≈´nya·πÅ
j√±ƒÅna-karmƒÅdy-anƒÅv·πõtam
ƒÅnuk≈´lyena k·πõ·π£·πáƒÅnu-

‚ÄúOne should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service.‚Äù
When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.
Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, the search for mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service."

But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure devotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association with pure devotees the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected in devotional service that material contamination cannot touch him."

It is not that devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to the Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a
mahƒÅtmƒÅ,
or great soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange of affection. Out of affection they ask the Lord for some material benefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot be separated from him.

In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one‚Äôs attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes, and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus he thinks of everything in relation to VƒÅsudeva, or ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. Such a universal vision of VƒÅsudeva precipitates one‚Äôs full surrender to the Supreme Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.
This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter (verses 14 and 15) of the

In the

it is recommended that whether one is a pure devotee and is free from all material desires, or is full of material desires, or desires liberation from material contamination, he should in all cases surrender to VƒÅsudeva and worship Him. As stated in the

Less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in the lower modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the master of all. In the
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
(
ƒÄdi

it is said,
ekale ƒ´≈õvara k·πõ·π£·πáa, ƒÅra saba bh·πõtya:
only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is master, and all others are servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives."

I am in everyone‚Äôs heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity.","Purport
God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone‚Äôs heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence ‚Äì whatever one likes ‚Äì but His ultimate instruction we find in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ:
one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.
Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvatƒ´; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess UmƒÅ, the wife of Lord ≈öiva. In this way there are recommendations in the
≈õƒÅstras
(Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul who is present in the hearts of all living entities, K·πõ·π£·πáa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature it is stated: ‚ÄúThe Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependent on the supreme will. They are not independent.‚Äù"

Endowed with such a faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.","Purport
The demigods cannot award benedictions to their devotees without the permission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service to the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.
For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities, who therefore prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord."

Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.","Purport
Some commentators on the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
say that one who worships a demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god‚Äôs planet. It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.
Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don‚Äôt know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn‚Äôt very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.
Not only are the demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
it is stated that the
brƒÅhma·πáas
are the head of the Supreme Lord, the
k·π£atriyas
are His arms, the
vai≈õyas
are His waist, the
≈õ≈´dras
are His legs, and all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and he himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.
The results achieved by the demigods‚Äô benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited."

Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. YƒÅmunƒÅcƒÅrya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession of RƒÅmƒÅnujƒÅcƒÅrya, has written a very appropriate verse in this connection. He says,

‚ÄúMy dear Lord, devotees like VyƒÅsadeva and NƒÅrada know You to be the Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing
VedƒÅnta
and the
Upani·π£ads
and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead.‚Äù (
Stotra-ratna
12)
In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the
VedƒÅnta
literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only are the worshipers of the demigods less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in
VedƒÅnta
and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God‚Äôs personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as
abuddhaya·∏•,
which means those who do not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul ‚Äì but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya, who has specifically stated that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K·πõ·π£·πáa to be only the son of Devakƒ´ and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(9.11)
.
AvajƒÅnanti mƒÅ·πÅ m≈´·∏çhƒÅ mƒÅnu·π£ƒ´·πÅ tanum ƒÅ≈õritam:
‚ÄúOnly the fools regard Me as an ordinary person.‚Äù
The fact is that no one can understand K·πõ·π£·πáa without rendering devotional service and without developing K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The
BhƒÅgavatam
(10.14.29)
confirms this:

‚ÄúMy Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the
Vedas
for many years.‚Äù One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, beginning by chanting the
mahƒÅ-mantra
‚Äì Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare ‚Äì then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K·πõ·π£·πáa has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything are
mƒÅyƒÅ.
These impersonalists are known as MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´s. They do not know the ultimate truth.
The twentieth verse clearly states,
kƒÅmais tais tair h·πõta-j√±ƒÅnƒÅ·∏• prapadyante ‚Äônya-devatƒÅ·∏•:
‚ÄúThose who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods.‚Äù It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets, and the Lord also has a planet. As stated in the twenty-third verse,
devƒÅn deva-yajo yƒÅnti mad-bhaktƒÅ yƒÅnti mƒÅm api:
the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa go to the K·πõ·π£·πáaloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.
Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda,
eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedic literature confirms that the Supreme Absolute Truth is knowledge and blissful pleasure,
vij√±ƒÅnam ƒÅnandam brahma
(
B·πõhad-ƒÅra·πáyaka Upani·π£ad
3.9.28), and that He is the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities,
ananta-kalyƒÅna-gu·πáƒÅtmako ‚Äôsau
(
Vi·π£·πáu PurƒÅ·πáa
6.5.84). And in the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
the Lord says that although He is
aja
(unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, has both form and personality."

In the assembly of Kurus, when ≈öi≈õupƒÅla spoke against K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs being elected president of the assembly, Bhƒ´·π£ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man. Therefore in the

K·πõ·π£·πáa says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His internal potency.
In the prayers of Kuntƒ´ in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(1.8.19)
it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of
yoga-mƒÅyƒÅ
and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. This
yoga-mƒÅyƒÅ
curtain is also confirmed in the

(10.14.7)
there is this prayer by BrahmƒÅ: ‚ÄúO Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world?

Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K·πõ·π£·πáa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were
mƒÅyƒÅ,
material, as the impersonalists consider Him to be, then like the living entity He would change His body and forget everything about His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.
Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa remembers instructing VivasvƒÅn, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K·πõ·π£·πáa knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being‚Äôs heart as the Supersoul. But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent, even if able to realize the impersonal Brahman, cannot realize ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and
mƒÅyƒÅ
is like a cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered. Similarly,
mƒÅyƒÅ
cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is. Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, without being in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in the association of pure devotees, for in the association of great devotees one can be delivered from delusion.
It is stated in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(5.5.2)
that if one actually wants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees (
mahat-sevƒÅ·πÅ dvƒÅram ƒÅhur vimukte·∏•
); but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence (
tamo-dvƒÅra·πÅ yo·π£itƒÅ·πÅ sa·πÖgi-sa·πÖgam
). All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violation of God‚Äôs law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination."

Birth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service is really liberated.
Aha·πÅ brahmƒÅsmi:
I am spirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman, spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental activities.
Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of K·πõ·π£·πáa known as Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. Only persons who perform activities in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness (
mƒÅm ƒÅ≈õritya
) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the K·πõ·π£·πáa planet. Such persons have no misgivings about K·πõ·π£·πáa, and thus they are factually Brahman.
Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or

Those in full consciousness of Me, who know Me, the Supreme Lord, to be the governing principle of the material manifestation, of the demigods, and of all methods of sacrifice, can understand and know Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even at the time of death.","Purport
Persons acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are never deviated from the path of entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person can never forget K·πõ·π£·πáa. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana.
This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person. The beginning of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is association of persons who are K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K·πõ·π£·πáa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K·πõ·π£·πáa and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual development of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K·πõ·π£·πáa he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.
Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as an eternal servitor of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by his doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called
d·πõ·∏çha-vrata,
and it is the beginning of
bhakti-yoga,
or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is the substance of that conviction.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute."

which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary,
ƒÅtmƒÅ
refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.

‚ÄúLord of sacrifice‚Äù may refer to either Indra or Vi·π£·πáu. Vi·π£·πáu is the chief of the primal demigods, including BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi·π£·πáu are worshiped by
yaj√±a
performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of
yaj√±a
(sacrifice) and how the Lord is residing within the body of the living entity.
Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhus≈´dana because K·πõ·π£·πáa once killed a demon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna, because Arjuna is a K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K·πõ·π£·πáa is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhus≈´dana so that K·πõ·π£·πáa might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna‚Äôs mind.
Now the word
prayƒÅ·πáa-kƒÅle
in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna is very anxious to know of those who are constantly engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. What should be their position at that final moment? At the time of death all the bodily functions are disrupted, and the mind is not in a proper condition. Thus disturbed by the bodily situation, one may not be able to remember the Supreme Lord. MahƒÅrƒÅja Kula≈õekhara, a great devotee, prays, ‚ÄúMy dear Lord, just now I am quite healthy, and it is better that I die immediately so that the swan of my mind can seek entrance at the stem of Your lotus feet.‚Äù The metaphor is used because the swan, a bird of the water, takes pleasure in digging into the lotus flowers; its sporting proclivity is to enter the lotus flower. MahƒÅrƒÅja Kula≈õekhara says to the Lord, ‚ÄúNow my mind is undisturbed, and I am quite healthy. If I die immediately, thinking of Your lotus feet, then I am sure that my performance of Your devotional service will become perfect. But if I have to wait for my natural death, then I do not know what will happen, because at that time the bodily functions will be disrupted, my throat will be choked up, and I do not know whether I shall be able to chant Your name. Better let me die immediately.‚Äù Arjuna questions how a person can fix his mind on K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs lotus feet at such a time."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The indestructible, transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called adhyƒÅtma, the self. Action pertaining to the development of the material bodies of the living entities is called karma, or fruitive activities.","Purport
Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Para-brahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Para-brahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual consciousness, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called
karma,
or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.
In Vedic literature the living entity is called
jƒ´vƒÅtmƒÅ
and Brahman, but he is never called Para-brahman. The living entity (
jƒ´vƒÅtmƒÅ
) takes different positions ‚Äì sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior, spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord‚Äôs marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In material nature he is manifested sometimes as a man, demigod, animal, beast, bird, etc., according to his
karma.
To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (
yaj√±a
), but when his merit is exhausted he returns to earth again in the form of a man. This process is called
karma.
The
ChƒÅndogya Upani·π£ad
describes the Vedic sacrificial process. On the sacrificial altar, five kinds of offerings are made into five kinds of fire. The five kinds of fire are conceived of as the heavenly planets, clouds, the earth, man and woman, and the five kinds of sacrificial offerings are faith, the enjoyer on the moon, rain, grains and semen.
In the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.
Impersonalist commentators on the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of
jƒ´va
in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ.
But in this verse the Lord also speaks of the living entity as ‚Äúan eternal fragment of Myself.‚Äù The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of
jƒ´va
is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Para-brahman (the Supreme Lord)."

The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is called

And present in the body along with the individual soul is the Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. The Supersoul is called the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ or
adhiyaj√±a
and is situated in the heart. The word
eva
is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul‚Äôs activities and is the source of the soul‚Äôs various types of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity to act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called
adhidaivata
is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, or
virƒÅ·π≠-puru·π£a,
whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system."

smaran
(‚Äúremembering‚Äù) is important. Remembrance of K·πõ·π£·πáa is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in devotional service. Therefore one should practice K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to achieve success at the end of his life, the process of remembering K·πõ·π£·πáa is essential.

taror api sahi·π£·πáunƒÅ
). There may be so many impediments for a person who is chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa. Nonetheless, tolerating all these impediments, one should continue to chant Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare, so that at the end of one‚Äôs life one can have the full benefit of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, O son of Kuntƒ´, that state he will attain without fail.","Purport
The process of changing one‚Äôs nature at the critical moment of death is here explained. A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa attains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of something other than K·πõ·π£·πáa attains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind? MahƒÅrƒÅja Bharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one‚Äôs thoughts during the course of one‚Äôs life accumulate to influence one‚Äôs thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one‚Äôs next life. If in one‚Äôs present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks of K·πõ·π£·πáa, it is possible for one to remember K·πõ·π£·πáa at the end of one‚Äôs life. That will help one be transferred to the transcendental nature of K·πõ·π£·πáa. If one is transcendentally absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting of Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare is the best process for successfully changing one‚Äôs state of being at the end of one‚Äôs life."

Puru·π£am
means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, VƒÅsudeva, etc.
The devotee can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features ‚Äì NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa, RƒÅma, etc. ‚Äì by chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God.
Yoga
practice is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa one fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of K·πõ·π£·πáa. One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think of K·πõ·π£·πáa, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as K·πõ·π£·πáa."

The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord is
puru·π£a,
a person ‚Äì we think of the person RƒÅma and the person K·πõ·π£·πáa. And whether one thinks of RƒÅma or of K·πõ·π£·πáa, what He is like is described in this verse of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The Lord is
kavi;
that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word
acintya
(‚Äúinconceivable‚Äù) is very significant in this connection. God‚Äôs energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (
acintya
). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world ‚Äì so how can we comprehend what is beyond?
Acintya
means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the
Vedas, Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
and follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding."

and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman‚Äôs features. This practice is very essential for the student‚Äôs advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such
brahmacƒÅrƒ´
(unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one‚Äôs practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the
brahmacƒÅrƒ´
principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this Age of Kali, that in this age no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy names of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa: Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare."

The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.","Purport
To practice
yoga
as suggested here, one first has to close the doors of all sense enjoyment. This practice is called
pratyƒÅhƒÅra,
or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects. The sense organs for acquiring knowledge ‚Äì the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch ‚Äì should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart, and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age. The best process is K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on K·πõ·π£·πáa in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in

This verse especially describes the final destination attained by the unalloyed devotees who serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
bhakti-yoga.
Previous verses have mentioned four different kinds of devotees ‚Äì the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation have also been described:
karma-yoga, j√±ƒÅna-yoga
and
ha·π≠ha-yoga.
The principles of these
yoga
systems have some
bhakti
added, but this verse particularly mentions pure
bhakti-yoga,
without any mixture of
j√±ƒÅna, karma
or
ha·π≠ha.
As indicated by the word
ananya-cetƒÅ·∏•,
in pure
bhakti-yoga
the devotee desires nothing but K·πõ·π£·πáa. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the
brahma-jyotir
or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In the
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
the pure devotee is called
ni·π£kƒÅma,
which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas a
j√±ƒÅna-yogƒ´, karma-yogƒ´
or
ha·π≠ha-yogƒ´
has his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.
A pure devotee always engages in devotional service to K·πõ·π£·πáa in one of His various personal features. K·πõ·π£·πáa has various plenary expansions and incarnations, such as RƒÅma and N·πõsi·πÅha, and a devotee can choose to fix his mind in loving service to any of these transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other
yogas. Bhakti-yoga
is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin simply by chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa. The Lord is merciful to all, but as we have already explained, He is especially inclined toward those who always serve Him without deviation. The Lord helps such devotees in various ways. As stated in the
Vedas
(
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
1.2.23),
yam evai·π£a v·πõ·πáute tena labhyas/ tasyai·π£a ƒÅtmƒÅ viv·πõ·πáute tanu·πÅ svƒÅm:
one who is fully surrendered and engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord can understand the Supreme Lord as He is. And as stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(10.10)
,
dadƒÅmi buddhi-yoga·πÅ tam:
the Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.
The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa without deviation and without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V·πõndƒÅvana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V·πõndƒÅvana by his devotional service. It was ≈örƒ´ Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, ‚ÄúWherever You are, O Lord ‚Äì
there
is V·πõndƒÅvana.‚Äù
As indicated by the words
satatam
and
nitya≈õa·∏•,
which mean ‚Äúalways,‚Äù ‚Äúregularly,‚Äù or ‚Äúevery day,‚Äù a pure devotee constantly remembers K·πõ·π£·πáa and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee, for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.
Bhakti-yoga
is the system that the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
recommends above all others. Generally, the
bhakti-yogƒ´s
are engaged in five different ways: (1)
≈õƒÅnta-bhakta,
engaged in devotional service in neutrality; (2)
dƒÅsya-bhakta,
engaged in devotional service as servant; (3)
sakhya-bhakta,
engaged as friend; (4)
vƒÅtsalya-bhakta,
engaged as parent; and (5)
mƒÅdhurya-bhakta,
engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious process of chanting the
mahƒÅ-mantra
‚Äì Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare."

Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains the supreme planet, K·πõ·π£·πáaloka, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana, does not wish to return. The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as
avyakta
and
ak·π£ara
and
paramƒÅ gati;
in other words, that planet is beyond our material vision, and it is inexplicable, but it is the highest goal, the destination for the
mahƒÅtmƒÅs
(great souls). The
mahƒÅtmƒÅs
receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want K·πõ·π£·πáa and K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs association, and nothing else. That is the highest perfection of life. This verse specifically mentions the personalist devotees of the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa. These devotees in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness achieve the highest perfection of life. In other words, they are the supreme souls."

Those who attain the highest material planets, the planets of the demigods, are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people on higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called
pa√±cƒÅgni-vidyƒÅ,
recommended in the
ChƒÅndogya Upani·π£ad,
enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, on Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness on the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom. Baladeva VidyƒÅbh≈´·π£a·πáa, in his commentary on

quotes this verse:

The duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of
kalpas.
A
kalpa
is a day of BrahmƒÅ, and one day of BrahmƒÅ consists of a thousand cycles of four
yugas,
or ages: Satya, TretƒÅ, DvƒÅpara and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the
yuga
lasts 1,728,000 years. In the TretƒÅ-yuga vice is introduced, and this
yuga
lasts 1,296,000 years. In the DvƒÅpara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this
yuga
lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the
yuga
we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this
yuga
lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the
yuga
the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki
avatƒÅra,
vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling again. These four
yugas,
rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of BrahmƒÅ, and the same number comprise one night. BrahmƒÅ lives one hundred of such ‚Äúyears‚Äù and then dies. These ‚Äúhundred years‚Äù by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 billion earth years. By these calculations the life of BrahmƒÅ seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the Causal Ocean there are innumerable BrahmƒÅs rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic. BrahmƒÅ and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.
In the material universe not even BrahmƒÅ is free from the process of birth, old age, disease and death. BrahmƒÅ, however, is directly engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe ‚Äì therefore he at once attains liberation. Elevated
sannyƒÅsƒ´s
are promoted to BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course BrahmƒÅ and all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature."

The less intelligent, who try to remain within this material world, may be elevated to higher planets and then again must come down to this planet earth. During the daytime of BrahmƒÅ they can exhibit their activities on higher and lower planets within this material world, but at the coming of BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs night they are all annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies for material activities, and at night they no longer have bodies but remain compact in the body of Vi·π£·πáu. Then again they are manifest at the arrival of BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs day.

during the day they become manifest, and at night they are annihilated again. Ultimately, when BrahmƒÅ‚Äôs life is finished, they are all annihilated and remain unmanifest for millions and millions of years. And when BrahmƒÅ is born again in another millennium they are again manifest. In this way they are captivated by the spell of the material world. But those intelligent persons who take to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness use the human life fully in the devotional service of the Lord, chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare.

The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is described in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
as
cintƒÅma·πái-dhƒÅma,
a place where all desires are fulfilled. The supreme abode of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, known as Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana, is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees, called ‚Äúdesire trees,‚Äù that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows, known as
surabhi
cows, which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak·π£mƒ´s), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (
ve·πáu·πÅ kva·πáantam
). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds ‚Äì His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa gives only a small hint of His personal abode, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana, which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ.
Vedic literatures (
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
1.3.11) state that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination (
puru·π£ƒÅn na para·πÅ ki√±cit sƒÅ kƒÅ·π£·π≠hƒÅ paramƒÅ gati·∏•
). When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs supreme abode and K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V·πõndƒÅvana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana located in the spiritual sky. When K·πõ·π£·πáa descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as V·πõndƒÅvana, comprising about 168 square miles in the district of MathurƒÅ, India."

It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination, from which there is no return, is the abode of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Person. The
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
describes this supreme abode as
ƒÅnanda-cinmaya-rasa,
a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss ‚Äì nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere ‚Äì both in the material and in the spiritual universes.
YasyƒÅnta·∏•-sthƒÅni
means that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies.
To enter K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs supreme abode or the innumerable Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets is possible only by
bhakti,
devotional service, as clearly indicated here by the word
bhaktyƒÅ.
No other process can help one attain that supreme abode. The
Vedas
(
GopƒÅla-tƒÅpanƒ´ Upani·π£ad
1.21) also describe the supreme abode and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Eko va≈õƒ´ sarva-ga·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa·∏•.
In that abode there is only one Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose name is K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is the supreme merciful Deity, and although situated there as one He has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. The
Vedas
compare the Lord to a tree standing still yet bearing many varieties of fruits, flowers and changing leaves. The plenary expansions of the Lord who preside over the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets are four-armed, and they are known by a variety of names ‚Äì Puru·π£ottama, Trivikrama, Ke≈õava, MƒÅdhava, Aniruddha, H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa, Sa·πÖkar·π£a·πáa, Pradyumna, ≈örƒ´dhara, VƒÅsudeva, DƒÅmodara, JanƒÅrdana, NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, VƒÅmana, PadmanƒÅbha, etc.
The
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ

karma-yoga, j√±ƒÅna-yoga

If the

is perfect he can select the time and situation for leaving this material world. But if he is not so expert his success depends on his accidentally passing away at a certain suitable time.

K·πõ·π£·πáa is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A devotee of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart by arrangement or by accident. The devotee should be firmly established in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and chant Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa. He should know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome. The best way to be absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is to be always dovetailed in His service, and this will make one‚Äôs path to the spiritual kingdom safe, certain and direct. The word

A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, undergoing austerities, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. Simply by performing devotional service, he attains all these, and at the end he reaches the supreme eternal abode.","Purport
This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth chapters, which particularly deal with K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the
Vedas
under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A
brahmacƒÅrƒ´
has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master‚Äôs order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing
brahmacarya.
After the student studies the
Vedas
under the master for some time ‚Äì at least from age five to twenty ‚Äì he becomes a man of perfect character. Study of the
Vedas
is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character. After this training, the
brahmacƒÅrƒ´
is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he has to perform many sacrifices so that he may achieve further enlightenment. He must also give charity according to the country, time and candidate, discriminating among charity in goodness, in passion and in ignorance, as described in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of
vƒÅnaprastha,
he undergoes severe penances ‚Äì living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of
brahmacarya,
householder life,
vƒÅnaprastha
and finally
sannyƒÅsa,
one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal
brahma-jyotir
or in the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets or K·πõ·π£·πáaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.
The beauty of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all the rituals of the different orders of life.
The words
ida·πÅ viditvƒÅ
indicate that one should understand the instructions given by ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa in this chapter and the Seventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
One should try to understand these chapters not by scholarship or mental speculation but by hearing them in association with devotees. Chapters Seven through Twelve are the essence of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The first six and the last six chapters are like coverings for the middle six chapters, which are especially protected by the Lord. If one is fortunate enough to understand
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
‚Äì especially these middle six chapters ‚Äì in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc., for one can achieve all the results of these activities simply by K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
One who has a little faith in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
should learn
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
from a devotee, because in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated clearly that
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
can be understood only by devotees; no one else can perfectly understand the purpose of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
One should therefore learn
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
from a devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa, not from mental speculators. This is a sign of faith. When one searches for a devotee and fortunately gets a devotee‚Äôs association one actually begins to study and understand
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
By advancement in the association of the devotee one is placed in devotional service, and this service dispels all one‚Äôs misgivings about K·πõ·π£·πáa, or God, and K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs activities, form, pastimes, name and other features. After these misgivings have been perfectly cleared away, one becomes fixed in one‚Äôs study. Then one relishes the study of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and attains the state of feeling always K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K·πõ·π£·πáa. This highest perfectional stage of life enables the devotee to be transferred to K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana, where the devotee becomes eternally happy.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of Attaining the Supreme."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most confidential knowledge and realization, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.","Purport
As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam:
‚ÄúThe messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees.‚Äù This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.
The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord‚Äôs service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa in the association of devotees. Discussion of K·πõ·π£·πáa is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.
The very beginning of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, they are called more confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.
Now this first verse has specific significance. The words
ida·πÅ j√±ƒÅnam
(‚Äúthis knowledge‚Äù) refer to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. When one‚Äôs heart is thus cleared of material contamination, one can understand this science of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and the spiritual activities of one who understands that he is not the body.
In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and superior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapter Nine the glories of the Lord will be delineated.
The Sanskrit word
anas≈´yave
in this verse is also very significant. Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K·πõ·π£·πáa, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are bona fide. No one can explain
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
or give perfect knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K·πõ·π£·πáa without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial."

This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.","Purport
This chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. Among the principal philosophers in India are Gautama, Ka·πáƒÅda, Kapila, YƒÅj√±avalkya, ≈öƒÅ·πá·∏çilya and Vai≈õvƒÅnara. And finally there is VyƒÅsadeva, the author of the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra.
So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the
Vedas
and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.
Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of the body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.
The
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable (
antavanta ime dehƒÅ nityasyoktƒÅ·∏• ≈õarƒ´ri·πáa·∏•
). That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that the spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.
This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as explained in Vedic literature. In the
Padma PurƒÅ·πáa,
man‚Äôs sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers and bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still to be enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain.
As explained in the twenty-eighth verse of the Seventh Chapter, a person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. This statement is confirmed in the
Padma PurƒÅ·πáa:
aprƒÅrabdha-phala·πÅ pƒÅpa·πÅ
k≈´·π≠a·πÅ bƒ´ja·πÅ phalonmukham
krame·πáaiva pralƒ´yeta
vi·π£·πáu-bhakti-ratƒÅtmanƒÅm
For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called
pavitram uttamam,
the purest.
Uttama
means transcendental.
Tamas
means this material world or darkness, and
uttama
means that which is transcendental to material activities. Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.
It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of K·πõ·π£·πáa (Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare) in course of chanting without offenses feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.
In the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
(3.2.26) this is also described in the following words:
prakƒÅ≈õa≈õ ca karma·πáy abhyƒÅsƒÅt.
‚ÄúDevotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service one becomes enlightened without a doubt.‚Äù A practical example of this can be seen in the previous life of NƒÅrada, who in that life happened to be the son of a maidservant. He had no education, nor was he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, NƒÅrada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. NƒÅrada personally says,
ucchi·π£·π≠a-lepƒÅn anumodito dvijai·∏•
sak·πõt sma bhu√±je tad-apƒÅsta-kilbi·π£a·∏•
eva·πÅ prav·πõttasya vi≈õuddha-cetasas
tad-dharma evƒÅtma-ruci·∏• prajƒÅyate
In this verse from
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(1.5.25)
NƒÅrada describes his previous life to his disciple VyƒÅsadeva. He says that while engaged as a boy servant for those purified devotees during the four months of their stay, he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees for their permission, and when they gave it NƒÅrada ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as pure-hearted as the sages. The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service to the Lord by hearing and chanting, and NƒÅrada gradually developed the same taste. NƒÅrada says further,
tatrƒÅnv-aha·πÅ k·πõ·π£·πáa-kathƒÅ·∏• pragƒÅyatƒÅm

priya≈õravasy a·πÖga mamƒÅbhavad ruci·∏•
By associating with the sages, NƒÅrada got the taste for hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, and he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore, as described in the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra, prakƒÅ≈õa≈õ ca karma·πáy abhyƒÅsƒÅt:
if one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called
pratyak·π£a,
directly perceived.
The word
dharmyam
means ‚Äúthe path of religion.‚Äù NƒÅrada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child NƒÅrada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religion. The highest goal of all religion is devotional service, as stated in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(
sa vai pu·πÅsƒÅ·πÅ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhok·π£aje
). Religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of devotional service. As we have already discussed in regard to the last verse of Chapter Eight (
vede·π£u yaj√±e·π£u tapa·∏•su caiva
), generally Vedic knowledge is required for self-realization. But here, although NƒÅrada never went to the school of the spiritual master and was not educated in the Vedic principles, he acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature:
ƒÅcƒÅryavƒÅn puru·π£o veda.
One who is in association with great
ƒÅcƒÅryas,
even if he is not educated or has never studied the
Vedas,
can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization.
The process of devotional service is a very happy one (
su-sukham
). Why? Devotional service consists of
≈õrava·πáa·πÅ kƒ´rtana·πÅ vi·π£·πáo·∏•,
so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized
ƒÅcƒÅryas.
Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says,
patra·πÅ pu·π£pa·πÅ phala·πÅ toyam:
He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by
any
person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There are many instances in history. Simply by tasting the
tulasƒ´
leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanat-kumƒÅra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.
It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophers claim. Although they sometimes take to so-called devotional service, their idea is that as long as they are not liberated they will continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they will ‚Äúbecome one with God.‚Äù Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.
As will be seen in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
actual devotional service begins after liberation. After one is liberated, when one is situated in the Brahman position (
brahma-bh≈´ta
), one‚Äôs devotional service begins (
sama·∏• sarve·π£u bh≈´te·π£u mad-bhakti·πÅ labhate parƒÅm
). No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing
karma-yoga, j√±ƒÅna-yoga, a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga
or any other
yoga
independently. By these yogic methods one may make a little progress toward
bhakti-yoga,
but without coming to the stage of devotional service one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
or
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
from realized souls, then he can understand the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, or the science of God.
Eva·πÅ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata·∏•.
When one‚Äôs heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it."

The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most important factor for progress in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. In the
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
it is said that faith is the complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, one can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. As stated in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(4.31.14)
,

‚ÄúBy giving water to the root of a tree one satisfies its branches, twigs and leaves, and by supplying food to the stomach one satisfies all the senses of the body. Similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord one automatically satisfies all the demigods and all other living entities.‚Äù Therefore, after reading
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
one should promptly come to the conclusion of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ:
one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.
Now, the development of that faith is the process of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. There are three divisions of K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. Even if they are officially engaged in devotional service, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven‚Äôt complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well situated they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that
k·πõ·π£·πáa-bhakti,
or service to K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. Thus they are superior to the third class, who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class he does not fall down, and for the first-class person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness there is no chance of falling down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K·πõ·π£·πáa is very good, he has not yet gained adequate knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa through the scriptures like
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
and
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
Sometimes these third-class persons in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness have some tendency toward
karma-yoga
and
j√±ƒÅna-yoga,
and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of
karma-yoga
or
j√±ƒÅna-yoga
is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Faith in K·πõ·π£·πáa is also divided into three stages and described in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam.
First-class attachment, second-class attachment and third-class attachment are also explained in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K·πõ·π£·πáa and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope of gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service."

Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.38)
it is stated,
premƒÅ√±jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa·∏• sadaiva h·πõdaye·π£u vilokayanti:
one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if one has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. This is indicated here by the word
avyakta-m≈´rtinƒÅ.
But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies ‚Äì the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.
Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such an argument the Lord says, ‚ÄúI am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.‚Äù For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king‚Äôs energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king‚Äôs power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as stated in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, vi·π£·π≠abhyƒÅham ida·πÅ k·πõtsnam:
He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies."

The Lord says that everything is resting on Him (
mat-sthƒÅni sarva-bh≈´tƒÅni
). This should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, ‚ÄúAlthough they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead I am aloof from them.‚Äù This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.
In the
Nirukti
Vedic dictionary it is said,
yujyate ‚Äônena durgha·π≠e·π£u kƒÅrye·π£u:
‚ÄúThe Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy.‚Äù His person is full of different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood. We may think of doing something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like. But when K·πõ·π£·πáa wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of the entire material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will, everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally. He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him. This is explained here as
yogam ai≈õvaram,
the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive. And in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic world. The movement of the air influences the movements of everything. But although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as the sky is always aloof from the activities of the wind.

After one hundred such years, when BrahmƒÅ dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself.

This material world is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At the creation, the material energy is let loose as the
mahat-tattva,
into which the Lord as His first
puru·π£a
incarnation, MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu, enters. He lies within the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu. Each universe is in that way created. He still further manifests Himself as K·π£ƒ´rodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu, and that Vi·π£·πáu enters into everything ‚Äì even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He enters into everything.
Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The activities of the different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the creation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are created immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts, birds ‚Äì everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested. It is clearly indicated here by the word
ava≈õam
that the living entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has no connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become involved with it."

One should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. In the

‚ÄúHe is always involved in His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities.‚Äù Material activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality is mentioned here with the word
udƒÅsƒ´na-vat.
Although He has control over every minute detail of material activities, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high-court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening ‚Äì someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth ‚Äì but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that gain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity. In the

(2.1.34) it is stated,

He is not situated in the dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world.

It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature. K·πõ·π£·πáa also states in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
that of all the living entities in different forms and species, ‚ÄúI am the father.‚Äù The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the
sm·πõti:
when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities."

From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who consider K·πõ·π£·πáa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(
ƒ´≈õvara·∏• parama·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa·∏•
); He is the Supreme Lord.
There are many
ƒ´≈õvaras,
controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
it is said that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly, both in the material and spiritual world, but K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme controller (
ƒ´≈õvara·∏• parama·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa·∏•
), and His body is
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda,
nonmaterial.
Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here
mƒÅnu·π£ƒ´m
because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna‚Äôs, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraha
‚Äì eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic language also.
Sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-r≈´pƒÅya k·πõ·π£·πáƒÅya:
‚ÄúI offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.‚Äù (
GopƒÅla-tƒÅpanƒ´ Upani·π£ad

Tam eka·πÅ govindam:
‚ÄúYou are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.‚Äù
Sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraham:
‚ÄúAnd Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.‚Äù (
GopƒÅla-tƒÅpanƒ´ Upani·π£ad
1.38)
Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
who deride K·πõ·π£·πáa as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called
m≈´·∏çha,
for only foolish persons consider K·πõ·π£·πáa to be an ordinary human being. The foolish consider K·πõ·π£·πáa an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K·πõ·π£·πáa has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.
Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (
mama mƒÅyƒÅ duratyayƒÅ
), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to K·πõ·π£·πáa can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of K·πõ·π£·πáa is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually, although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning His
yogam ai≈õvaram,
His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K·πõ·π£·πáa, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.
There are many controversies between the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord‚Äôs appearance as a human being. But if we consult
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
the authoritative texts for understanding the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, then we can understand that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages headed by ≈öaunaka inquired about the activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa, they said:
k·πõtavƒÅn kila karmƒÅ·πái

‚ÄúLord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with BalarƒÅma, played like a human being, and so masked He performed many superhuman acts.‚Äù (
BhƒÅg.
1.1.20
) The Lord‚Äôs appearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that K·πõ·π£·πáa performed while He was present on this earth. When K·πõ·π£·πáa appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devakƒ´, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. As stated in the
BhƒÅgavatam
(10.3.46)
,
babh≈´va prƒÅk·πõta·∏• ≈õi≈õu·∏•:
He became just like an ordinary child, an ordinary human being. Now, here again it is indicated that the Lord‚Äôs appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
also it is stated that Arjuna prayed to see K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs form of four hands (
tenaiva r≈´pe·πáa catur-bhujena
). After revealing this form, K·πõ·π£·πáa, when petitioned by Arjuna, again assumed His original humanlike form (
mƒÅnu·π£a·πÅ r≈´pam
). These different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.
Some of those who deride K·πõ·π£·πáa and who are infected with the MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophy quote the following verse from the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(3.29.21)
to prove that K·πõ·π£·πáa is just an ordinary man.
Aha·πÅ sarve·π£u bh≈´te·π£u bh≈´tƒÅtmƒÅvasthita·∏• sadƒÅ:
‚ÄúThe Supreme is present in every living entity.‚Äù We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai·π£·πáava
ƒÅcƒÅryas
like Jƒ´va GosvƒÅmƒ´ and Vi≈õvanƒÅtha Cakravartƒ´ ·π¨hƒÅkura instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride K·πõ·π£·πáa. Jƒ´va GosvƒÅmƒ´, commenting on this verse, says that K·πõ·π£·πáa, in His plenary expansion as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the
arcƒÅ-m≈´rti,
the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Vi≈õvanƒÅtha Cakravartƒ´ ·π¨hƒÅkura warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that because K·πõ·π£·πáa is present in everyone‚Äôs heart as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord; so as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in which the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.
There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness knows that although K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as confirmed in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ.
Although His personal abode is Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana and He is always staying there, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation."

Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. In other words, persons who mock K·πõ·π£·πáa are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
such demonic miscreants never surrender to K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and K·πõ·π£·πáa are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with K·πõ·π£·πáa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
and the
Upani·π£ads,
is always baffled.
It is a great offense, therefore, to consider K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The

is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called
daivƒ´ prak·πõti,
divine nature. So when one is promoted in that way ‚Äì by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead ‚Äì one attains to the stage of great soul,
mahƒÅtmƒÅ.
The
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
does not divert his attention to anything outside K·πõ·π£·πáa, because he knows perfectly well that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a
mahƒÅtmƒÅ,
or great soul, develops through association with other
mahƒÅtmƒÅs,
pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs other features, such as the four-armed MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. They are not attracted to other features of K·πõ·π£·πáa, nor are they concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They meditate only upon K·πõ·π£·πáa in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness."

The
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His symptoms are described here: a
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
is always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the
brahma-jyotir,
is not described as
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
He is described in a different way in the next verse. The
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
hearing and chanting about Vi·π£·πáu, not a demigod or human being. That is devotion:
≈õrava·πáa·πÅ kƒ´rtana·πÅ vi·π£·πáo·∏•
and
smara·πáam,
remembering Him. Such a
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental
rasas.
To achieve that success, he engages all activities ‚Äì mental, bodily and vocal, everything ‚Äì in the service of the Supreme Lord, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa. That is called full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, EkƒÅda≈õƒ´, and on the appearance day of the Lord. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great
ƒÅcƒÅryas
for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The
mahƒÅtmƒÅs,
great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.
As described in the second verse of this chapter, not only is this devotional service easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a
sannyƒÅsƒ´
or a
brahmacƒÅrƒ´;
in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually
mahƒÅtmƒÅ,
a great soul."

This verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and do not know anything other than K·πõ·π£·πáa are called
mahƒÅtmƒÅ;
yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of
mahƒÅtmƒÅ
but who worship K·πõ·π£·πáa also, in different ways. Some of them have already been described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: (1) he who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, (2) he who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and (3) he who accepts the universal form, the
vi≈õva-r≈´pa
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord."

some of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of K·πõ·π£·πáa. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but K·πõ·π£·πáa. In this verse the word

One who does not know K·πõ·π£·πáa is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka, S≈´ryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such
lokas,
or planets, being creations of K·πõ·π£·πáa, are simultaneously K·πõ·π£·πáa and not K·πõ·π£·πáa. Such planets, being manifestations of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs energy, are also K·πõ·π£·πáa, but actually they serve only as a step forward for realization of K·πõ·π£·πáa. To approach the different energies of K·πõ·π£·πáa is to approach K·πõ·π£·πáa indirectly. One should directly approach K·πõ·π£·πáa, for that will save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs energy; therefore without K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs shelter nothing can exist. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. K·πõ·π£·πáa, being situated in everyone‚Äôs heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the ultimate goal of shelter, and therefore one should take shelter of K·πõ·π£·πáa either for protection or for annihilation of his distress. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme living entity. And since K·πõ·π£·πáa is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than K·πõ·π£·πáa, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K·πõ·π£·πáa is therefore the eternal cause of all causes."

and side by side trying to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the
Vedas
become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra and Candra. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary systems or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet."

If one has any desire to go to the moon, the sun or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose, such as the process technically known as Dar≈õa-paur·πáamƒÅsa. These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the
Vedas,
which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the PitƒÅ planets by performing a specific
yaj√±a.
Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a Yak·π£a, Rak·π£a or Pi≈õƒÅca. Pi≈õƒÅca worship is called ‚Äúblack arts‚Äù or ‚Äúblack magic.‚Äù There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaiku·πá·π≠ha and K·πõ·π£·πáaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the PitƒÅs achieve the PitƒÅ planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of K·πõ·π£·πáa or Vi·π£·πáu? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where K·πõ·π£·πáa and Vi·π£·πáu live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the
brahma-jyotir.
The K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa
mantra
one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead."

For the intelligent person, it is essential to be in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a permanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such a marvelous result is very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in this connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is or where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will be pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred from K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he does not want to be K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious by this simple method and thus attain the highest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge? K·πõ·π£·πáa wants only loving service and nothing more. K·πõ·π£·πáa accepts even a little flower from His pure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee. He is not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To develop K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the highest perfection of life.
Bhakti
is mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically that
bhakti,
or devotional service, is the only means to approach K·πõ·π£·πáa. No other condition, such as becoming a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
a learned scholar, a very rich man or a great philosopher, can induce K·πõ·π£·πáa to accept some offering. Without the basic principle of
bhakti,
nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept anything from anyone.
Bhakti
is never causal. The process is eternal. It is direct action in service to the absolute whole.
Here Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life ‚Äì the transcendental loving service of God ‚Äì then one should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K·πõ·π£·πáa will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked. Thus meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, ‚ÄúI will accept it.‚Äù Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.
In the Third Chapter, verse 13, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. K·πõ·π£·πáa has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K·πõ·π£·πáa.
The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the speaker of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
. But, in actuality, K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K·πõ·π£·πáa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K·πõ·π£·πáa has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs hearing the devotee‚Äôs words of love in offering foodstuffs is
wholly
identical with His eating and actually tasting. This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K·πõ·π£·πáa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it."

Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget K·πõ·π£·πáa in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and K·πõ·π£·πáa recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K·πõ·π£·πáa recommends, ‚ÄúDo it for Me,‚Äù and this is called
arcana.
Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; K·πõ·π£·πáa says, ‚ÄúGive it to Me,‚Äù and this means that all surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K·πõ·π£·πáa twenty-four hours a day by chanting the Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa

One who acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness under superior direction is called
yukta.
The technical term is
yukta-vairƒÅgya.
This is further explained by R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ as follows:
anƒÅsaktasya vi·π£ayƒÅn

(
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu,
1.2.255)
R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act; we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to K·πõ·π£·πáa, then that is called
yukta-vairƒÅgya.
Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he does not become one with the
brahma-jyotir,
but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here:
mƒÅm upai·π£yasi,
‚Äúhe comes to Me,‚Äù back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.
Anyone who has no interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a
sannyƒÅsƒ´.
Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependent on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the
Vedas.
For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the
Vedas,
but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.
It is said, therefore, by Vai·π£·πáava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The exact words are
tƒÅ·πÖra vƒÅkya, kriyƒÅ, mudrƒÅ vij√±eha nƒÅ bujhaya
(
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta, Madhya
23.39
). A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present, and in the future his going back home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all materialistic criticism, just as K·πõ·π£·πáa is above all criticism."

I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.","Purport
One may question here that if K·πõ·π£·πáa is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity ‚Äì in whatever form ‚Äì is His son, and so He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa. The very phrase ‚ÄúK·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness‚Äù suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly,
mayi te:
‚ÄúThey are in Me.‚Äù Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the words
ye yathƒÅ mƒÅ·πÅ prapadyante tƒÅ·πÅs tathaiva bhajƒÅmy aham:
‚ÄúWhoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.‚Äù This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.
The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is the manifestation of the Lord‚Äôs special mercy to the devotees. The Lord‚Äôs reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of
karma.
It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function. Devotional service to the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world, where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate."

Even if one commits the most abominable action, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated in his determination.","Purport
The word
su-durƒÅcƒÅra·∏•
used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
it is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a
yogƒ´
fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
Therefore a person who is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words
sƒÅdhur eva,
‚Äúhe is saintly,‚Äù are very emphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has accidentally fallen down. And the word
mantavya·∏•
is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then one is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.
In the
N·πõsi·πÅha PurƒÅ·πáa
the following statement is given:
bhagavati ca harƒÅv ananya-cetƒÅ
bh·πõ≈õa-malino ‚Äôpi virƒÅjate manu·π£ya·∏•
na hi ≈õa≈õa-kalu·π£a-cchabi·∏• kadƒÅcit
timira-parƒÅbhavatƒÅm upaiti candra·∏•
The meaning is that even if one fully engaged in the devotional service of the Lord is sometimes found engaged in abominable activities, these activities should be considered to be like the spots that resemble the mark of a rabbit on the moon. Such spots do not become an impediment to the diffusion of moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of saintly character does not make him abominable.
On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee."

This should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in abominable activities ‚Äì either by accident or by intention ‚Äì be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam.
Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the
Vedas,
there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations."

It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower and higher classes of people. In the material conception of life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(2.4.18)
it is stated that even the lowest, who are called
ca·πá·∏çƒÅlas
(dog-eaters), can be purified by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (
brƒÅhma·πáas
), the mode of passion (
k·π£atriyas,
or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (
vai≈õyas,
or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (
≈õ≈´dras,
or workers). Those lower than them are called
ca·πá·∏çƒÅlas,
and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the association of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes shelter of K·πõ·π£·πáa. As indicated here by the word
vyapƒÅ≈õritya,
one has to take shelter completely of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Then one can become much greater than great
j√±ƒÅnƒ´s
and
yogƒ´s."

In this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, this world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here,
anityam asukha·πÅ lokam:
this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for any sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be temporary and full of miseries. Some philosophers, especially MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophers, say that this world is false, but we can understand from
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a difference between temporary and false. This world is temporary, but there is another world, which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is eternal and blissful.
Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, ‚ÄúTake to My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home.‚Äù No one should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone should attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is the only process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved. Everyone should therefore take to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and make his life perfect."

In this verse it is clearly indicated that K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs mind and K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the
K≈´rma PurƒÅ·πáa,
as it is quoted by BhaktisiddhƒÅnta Sarasvatƒ´ GosvƒÅmƒ´ in his
AnubhƒÅ·π£ya
comments on
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
(Fifth Chapter,
ƒÄdi-lƒ´lƒÅ,
verses 41‚Äì48),
deha-dehi-vibhedo ‚Äôya·πÅ ne≈õvare vidyate kvacit.
This means that there is no difference in K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But because the commentators do not know this science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, they hide K·πõ·π£·πáa and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K·πõ·π£·πáa, some men make profit out of misleading people.
There are some who are demonic; they also think of K·πõ·π£·πáa, but enviously, just like King Ka·πÅsa, K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs uncle. He was also thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa always, but he thought of K·πõ·π£·πáa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K·πõ·π£·πáa would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa in devotional love. That is
bhakti.
One should cultivate the knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa continuously. What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K·πõ·π£·πáa will help one become a devotee. Understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa otherwise, from the wrong source, will prove fruitless.
One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa; with conviction in his heart that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and devotional service is practiced there. When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K·πõ·π£·πáa. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities ‚Äì everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K·πõ·π£·πáa without deviation. This will help one transfer to K·πõ·π£·πáaloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K·πõ·π£·πáa. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.
The Seventh and Eighth chapters of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
have explained pure devotional service to the Lord that is free from speculative knowledge, mystic
yoga
and fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord like the impersonal
brahma-jyotir
and localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.
There is a beautiful poem about K·πõ·π£·πáa in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and
yogƒ´s.
One who always engages in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness should be understood to be a perfectly saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down, because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to the process of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K·πõ·π£·πáa.

The word
bhagavƒÅn
is explained thus by ParƒÅ≈õara Muni: one who is full in six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation, is BhagavƒÅn, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While K·πõ·π£·πáa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages like ParƒÅ≈õara Muni have all accepted K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now K·πõ·π£·πáa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has already explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter He has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.
The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of devotees; that will enhance one‚Äôs devotional service. Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because Arjuna is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place."

As stated in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ,
Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Lord. No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K·πõ·π£·πáa; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful, uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa by such foolish speculation.
Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, ‚ÄúHere I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.‚Äù One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam.
The conception of God as some ruling power or as the impersonal Brahman can be reached by persons who are in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.
Because most men cannot understand K·πõ·π£·πáa in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord‚Äôs uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K·πõ·π£·πáa. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K·πõ·π£·πáa they can understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is
ƒÅtmƒÅ,
what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship."

manu·π£yƒÅ·πáƒÅ·πÅ sahasre·π£u ka≈õcid yatati siddhaye:
those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men; they are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization. But out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.
Here the Lord is described by the word
aja,
meaning ‚Äúunborn,‚Äù but He is distinct from the living entities who are described in the Second Chapter as
aja.
The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment. The conditioned souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior, material energy, but is always in the superior energy.
In this verse the words
vetti loka-mahe≈õvaram
indicate that one should know that Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme proprietor of the planetary systems of the universe. He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K·πõ·π£·πáa is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K·πõ·π£·πáa is different even from the great demigods like BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva. And because He is the creator of BrahmƒÅ, ≈öiva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.
≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reactions. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
One should not try to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa as a human being. As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.
If K·πõ·π£·πáa is known as the son of Devakƒ´, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam:
When He appeared before Devakƒ´ and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.
Anything done under the direction of K·πõ·π£·πáa is transcendental. It cannot be contaminated by material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material nature is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to be auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
and
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called
sannyƒÅsa.
As stated in the first verse of the Sixth Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
one who acts as a matter of duty because he has been ordered to do so by the Supreme Lord, and who does not seek shelter in the fruits of his activities (
anƒÅ≈õrita·∏• karma-phalam
), is a true renouncer. Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a
sannyƒÅsƒ´
and a
yogƒ´,
and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the
sannyƒÅsƒ´,
or a pseudo
yogƒ´."

The Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. BrahmƒÅ is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord, who is known as Hira·πáyagarbha.

There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and each planet is full of population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs. BrahmƒÅ underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods before he realized by the grace of K·πõ·π£·πáa how to create.

The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great. Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
and
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and similar literatures.
In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are BrahmƒÅ, Lord ≈öiva and the four great KumƒÅras and the other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the original forefather of all forefathers.
These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly convinced of them, he accepts K·πõ·π£·πáa with great faith and without any doubt, and he engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required in order to increase one‚Äôs interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord. One should not neglect to understand fully how great K·πõ·π£·πáa is, for by knowing the greatness of K·πõ·π£·πáa one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional service."

Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K·πõ·π£·πáa, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.
In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the
brahma-jyotir
effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana, the supreme planet of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K·πõ·π£·πáa and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta
(
Madhya-lƒ´lƒÅ,
Chapter Nineteen). It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.
The
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
is also full of such narrations about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
is very dear to the devotees, as stated in the
BhƒÅgavatam
itself (12.13.18).
≈örƒ´mad-bhƒÅgavata·πÅ purƒÅ·πáam amala·πÅ yad vai·π£·πáavƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ priyam.
In this narration there is nothing about material activities, economic development, sense gratification or liberation.
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association."

In this verse the word
buddhi-yogam
is very significant. We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of
buddhi-yoga.
Now
buddhi-yoga
is explained.
Buddhi-yoga
itself is action in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence.
Buddhi
means intelligence, and
yoga
means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in devotional service, his action is called
buddhi-yoga.
In other words,
buddhi-yoga
is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K·πõ·π£·πáa. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K·πõ·π£·πáa, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.
When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in
karma-yoga.
When he knows that the goal is K·πõ·π£·πáa but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, he is acting in
j√±ƒÅna-yoga.
And when he knows the goal and seeks K·πõ·π£·πáa completely in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in
bhakti-yoga,
or
buddhi-yoga,
which is the complete
yoga.
This complete
yoga
is the highest perfectional stage of life.
A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but if he is still not intelligent enough to make progress, then K·πõ·π£·πáa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K·πõ·π£·πáa, and that work should be with love. If a devotee is not intelligent enough to make progress on the path of self-realization but is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him."

To show them special mercy, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.","Purport
When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. PrakƒÅ≈õƒÅnanda Sarasvatƒ´, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion. But even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
The MƒÅyƒÅvƒÅdƒ´ philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.
The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, or the Supreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K·πõ·π£·πáa, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K·πõ·π£·πáa within his heart; and with the presence of K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is just like the sun, the darkness of ignorance is at once dissipated. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K·πõ·π£·πáa.
Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one‚Äôs heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal, Vi·π£·πáu, can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the material necessities of life; he need not be anxious, because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, who is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the teachings of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
By studying
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
one can become a soul completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors."

should be understood in the

The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A common man or even a liberated man who has realized impersonal Brahman or localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ may not understand God‚Äôs personality. Such men, therefore, may endeavor to understand the Supreme Person from the verses of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
which are being spoken by this person, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K·πõ·π£·πáa as BhagavƒÅn, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand K·πõ·π£·πáa as Puru·π£ottama, the Supreme Person. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru·π£ottama. Yet one still may not understand that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Bh≈´ta-bhƒÅvana. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bh≈´te≈õa, the supreme controller of everyone. And even if one knows K·πõ·π£·πáa as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Deva-deva, the worshipful God of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagat-pati. Thus the truth about K·πõ·π£·πáa is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa as He is."

In this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. By K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs grace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person may have, and through all these agencies he has understood K·πõ·π£·πáa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For him there is no doubt, yet he is asking K·πõ·π£·πáa to explain His all-pervading nature. People in general and the impersonalists in particular concern themselves mainly with the all-pervading nature of the Supreme. So Arjuna is asking K·πõ·π£·πáa how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different energies. One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the common people."

O K·πõ·π£·πáa, O supreme mystic, how shall I constantly think of You, and how shall I know You? In what various forms are You to be remembered, O Supreme Personality of Godhead?","Purport
As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His
yoga-mƒÅyƒÅ.
Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that his friend, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot know K·πõ·π£·πáa, because He is guarded by His
yoga-mƒÅyƒÅ
energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. So Arjuna, out of his mercy, because he is a Vai·π£·πáava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addresses K·πõ·π£·πáa specifically as
yogin
because ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is the master of the
yoga-mƒÅyƒÅ
energy, by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K·πõ·π£·πáa cannot always think of K·πõ·π£·πáa; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. The words
ke·π£u ke·π£u ca bhƒÅve·π£u
refer to material nature (the word
bhƒÅva
means ‚Äúphysical things‚Äù). Because materialists cannot understand K·πõ·π£·πáa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how K·πõ·π£·πáa is manifested by physical representations."

A similar statement was made to S≈´ta GosvƒÅmƒ´ by the

of Naimi·π£ƒÅra·πáya, headed by ≈öaunaka. That statement is:

‚ÄúOne can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of K·πõ·π£·πáa, who is glorified by excellent prayers. Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa relish at every step the descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.‚Äù (
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
1.1.19
) Thus Arjuna is interested in hearing about K·πõ·π£·πáa, and specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.
Now as far as
am·πõtam,
nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning K·πõ·π£·πáa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories but one never tires of hearing about K·πõ·π£·πáa. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. The
PurƒÅ·πáas
are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.","Purport
It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of K·πõ·π£·πáa and His opulences. The senses of the individual soul are limited and do not permit him to understand the totality of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs affairs. Still the devotees try to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa fully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of K·πõ·π£·πáa are so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar. Thus the devotees enjoy them. In discussing K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K·πõ·π£·πáa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The word
prƒÅdhƒÅnyata·∏•
(‚Äúprincipal‚Äù) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And
vibh≈´ti,
as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In the
Amara-ko≈õa
dictionary it is stated that
vibh≈´ti
indicates an exceptional opulence.
The impersonalist or pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energies. Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation. Now K·πõ·π£·πáa is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way."

In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gu·∏çƒÅke≈õa, which means ‚Äúone who has conquered the darkness of sleep.‚Äù For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself in various ways in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by K·πõ·π£·πáa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.
K·πõ·π£·πáa first informs Arjuna that He is the soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the
puru·π£a
incarnation, and from Him everything begins. Therefore He is
ƒÅtmƒÅ,
the soul of the
mahat-tattva,
the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation; actually the MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu enters into the
mahat-tattva,
the total material energy. He is the soul. When MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul, K·πõ·π£·πáa, enters. As stated in the

As soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment. Thus death is devouring every living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself. That death is K·πõ·π£·πáa. As for future development, all living entities undergo six basic changes. They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle, and finally they vanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is K·πõ·π£·πáa. The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.
The seven opulences listed ‚Äì fame, fortune, fine speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness and patience ‚Äì are considered feminine.

Of the hymns in the SƒÅma Veda I am the B·πõhat-sƒÅma, and of poetry I am the GƒÅyatrƒ´. Of months I am MƒÅrga≈õƒ´r·π£a [November-December], and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.","Purport
It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the
Vedas,
He is the
SƒÅma Veda.
The
SƒÅma Veda
is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods. One of these songs is the
B·πõhat-sƒÅma,
which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.
In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated poetry, the GƒÅyatrƒ´
mantra,
which is chanted by the duly qualified
brƒÅhma·πáas,
is the most prominent. The GƒÅyatrƒ´
mantra
is mentioned in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam.
Because the GƒÅyatrƒ´
mantra
is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This
mantra
is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the GƒÅyatrƒ´
mantra.
The GƒÅyatrƒ´
mantra
is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman. BrahmƒÅ is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.
The month of November-December is considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa."

There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents K·πõ·π£·πáa. As the Supreme, K·πõ·π£·πáa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If K·πõ·π£·πáa chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not simply one-sided ‚Äì it is all-sided.
Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. Among the enterprising and industrious, He is the most enterprising, the most industrious. Among adventurers He is the most adventurous, and among the strong He is the strongest. When K·πõ·π£·πáa was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength. Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength."

K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Baladeva is K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs immediate expansion. Both Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa and Baladeva appeared as sons of Vasudeva, so both of Them may be called VƒÅsudeva. From another point of view, because K·πõ·π£·πáa never leaves V·πõndƒÅvana, all the forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa that appear elsewhere are His expansions. VƒÅsudeva is K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs immediate expansion, so VƒÅsudeva is not different from K·πõ·π£·πáa. It is to be understood that the VƒÅsudeva referred to in this verse of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is Baladeva, or BalarƒÅma, because He is the original source of all incarnations and thus He is the sole source of VƒÅsudeva. The immediate expansions of the Lord are called
svƒÅ·πÅ≈õa
(personal expansions), and there are also expansions called
vibhinnƒÅ·πÅ≈õa
(separated expansions).
Amongst the sons of PƒÅ·πá·∏çu, Arjuna is famous as Dhana√±jaya. He is the best of men and therefore represents K·πõ·π£·πáa. Among the
munis,
or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, VyƒÅsa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this Age of Kali. And VyƒÅsa is also known as an incarnation of K·πõ·π£·πáa; therefore VyƒÅsa also represents K·πõ·π£·πáa.
Kavis
are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the
kavis,
U≈õanƒÅ, ≈öukrƒÅcƒÅrya, was the spiritual master of the demons; he was an extremely intelligent and far-seeing politician. Thus ≈öukrƒÅcƒÅrya is another representative of the opulence of K·πõ·π£·πáa."

There are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those that cut down miscreants. When miscreants are punished, the agency of chastisement represents K·πõ·π£·πáa. Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise man is he who can discriminate between matter and spirit, between God‚Äôs superior and inferior natures. Such knowledge is K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself."

But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.","Purport
The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs entering them as Supersoul. From BrahmƒÅ, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.
There is a Mission that regularly propounds that worship of any demigod will lead one to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the supreme goal. But worship of demigods is thoroughly discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva represent only part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is
asamaurdhva,
which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him. In the
Padma PurƒÅ·πáa
it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa in the same category with demigods ‚Äì be they even BrahmƒÅ or ≈öiva ‚Äì becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa and can fix his mind in the worship of K·πõ·π£·πáa without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K·πõ·π£·πáa are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses 8 through 11. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter. ≈örƒ´la Baladeva VidyƒÅbh≈´·π£a·πáa, a great
ƒÅcƒÅrya
in disciplic succession from K·πõ·π£·πáa, concludes his commentary on this chapter by saying,
yac-chakti-le≈õƒÅt s≈´ryƒÅdyƒÅ
bhavanty aty-ugra-tejasa·∏•
yad-a·πÅ≈õena dh·πõta·πÅ vi≈õva·πÅ

From Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs potent energy even the powerful sun gets its power, and by K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs partial expansion the whole world is maintained. Therefore Lord ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa is worshipable.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute."

Arjuna said: By my hearing the instructions You have kindly given me about these most confidential spiritual subjects, my illusion has now been dispelled.","Purport
This chapter reveals K·πõ·π£·πáa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of the MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu, from whom the material universes emanate. K·πõ·π£·πáa is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.
Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K·πõ·π£·πáa as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has such a great friend as K·πõ·π£·πáa, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K·πõ·π£·πáa as the source of everything, others may not. So in order to establish K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs divinity for all, he is requesting K·πõ·π£·πáa in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K·πõ·π£·πáa is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K·πõ·π£·πáa has several times said: K·πõ·π£·πáa is speaking to him just for his benefit. So Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs grace. He is now convinced that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone‚Äôs heart as the Supersoul."

That is the inconceivable opulence of K·πõ·π£·πáa which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood."

O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see You here before me in Your actual position, as You have described Yourself, I wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.","Purport
The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K·πõ·π£·πáa, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that K·πõ·π£·πáa is an ordinary person, Arjuna desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it. Arjuna‚Äôs addressing the Lord as
puru·π£ottama
is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for Arjuna is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. But the Lord can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. Arjuna did not have any personal desire for confirmation. K·πõ·π£·πáa also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K·πõ·π£·πáa should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people."

It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs inestimable position. Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word
yoge≈õvara
is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K·πõ·π£·πáa. He does not give K·πõ·π£·πáa orders. K·πõ·π£·πáa is not obliged to reveal Himself unless one surrenders fully in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see K·πõ·π£·πáa."

It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see K·πõ·π£·πáa in this way, K·πõ·π£·πáa reveals this form.

A pure devotee does not like to see K·πõ·π£·πáa in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is not very important; that will be clear in subsequent verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.
Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the friends of K·πõ·π£·πáa and the parents of K·πõ·π£·πáa never want K·πõ·π£·πáa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Lord. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
it is stated that the boys who play with K·πõ·π£·πáa are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K·πõ·π£·πáa. Such boys do not know that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. Therefore ≈öukadeva GosvƒÅmƒ´ recites this verse:
ittha·πÅ satƒÅ·πÅ brahma-sukhƒÅnubh≈´tyƒÅ
dƒÅsya·πÅ gatƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ para-daivatena

‚ÄúHere is the Supreme Person, who is considered the impersonal Brahman by great sages, the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotees, and a product of material nature by ordinary men. Now these boys, who have performed many, many pious activities in their past lives, are playing with that Supreme Personality of Godhead.‚Äù (
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
10.12.11)
The fact is that the devotee is not concerned with seeing the
vi≈õva-r≈´pa,
the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs statements so that in the future people could understand that K·πõ·π£·πáa not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the
paramparƒÅ
system. Those who are actually interested in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K·πõ·π£·πáa not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.
The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained."

As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these.

Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna changes immediately. Before, K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna‚Äôs relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see K·πõ·π£·πáa as the reservoir of all relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in K·πõ·π£·πáa. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.
Here Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way."

Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees BrahmƒÅ, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu lies in the lower regions of the universe.

Although Arjuna knew that K·πõ·π£·πáa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was puzzled by the various forms exhibited by K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the
Vedas
that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even the
brƒÅhma·πáas.
As stated in the

(1.2.25),

Eventually all the

and everyone else are devoured like a meal by the Supreme. This form of the Supreme Lord is the all-devouring giant, and here K·πõ·π£·πáa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few PƒÅ·πá·∏çavas, everyone who was present on that battlefield would be devoured by Him. Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that was His plan. If Arjuna stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death could not be checked, even if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature."

Savya-sƒÅcin
refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies. ‚ÄúJust become an instrument‚Äù:
nimitta-mƒÅtram.
This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of ‚Äúperhaps‚Äù and ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and his life is devoted to the Lord‚Äôs transcendental service, he is perfect."

Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire. Life should therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master. The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as His plans. One should follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle for existence."

As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to K·πõ·π£·πáa again and again, and with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a friend, but as a devotee in wonder."

Arjuna, after hearing from K·πõ·π£·πáa about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra, became enlightened, and as a great devotee and friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said that everything done by K·πõ·π£·πáa is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruk·π£etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods,
siddhas,
and the intelligentsia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because K·πõ·π£·πáa was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all."

O great one, greater even than BrahmƒÅ, You are the original creator. Why then should they not offer their respectful obeisances unto You? O limitless one, God of gods, refuge of the universe! You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.","Purport
By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K·πõ·π£·πáa is worshipable by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is addressing K·πõ·π£·πáa as
mahƒÅtmƒÅ,
which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited.
Ananta
indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and
deve≈õa
means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the shelter of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him, because no one is greater than Him. Arjuna especially mentions that K·πõ·π£·πáa is greater than BrahmƒÅ because BrahmƒÅ is created by Him. BrahmƒÅ is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka-≈õƒÅyƒ´ Vi·π£·πáu, who is K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs plenary expansion; therefore BrahmƒÅ and Lord ≈öiva, who is born of BrahmƒÅ, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. It is stated in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
that the Lord is respected by Lord ≈öiva and BrahmƒÅ and similar other demigods. The word
ak·π£aram
is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme."

means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is the knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable.

The Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most important representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive. Arjuna also addresses K·πõ·π£·πáa as the great-grandfather because He is the father of BrahmƒÅ, the first living creature in the universe."

No one is greater than You, nor can anyone be one with You. How then could there be anyone greater than You within the three worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?","Purport
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to BrahmƒÅ and presently He is also instructing
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K·πõ·π£·πáa. Without being a representative of K·πõ·π£·πáa, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.
The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, because no one is equal to or higher than K·πõ·π£·πáa within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him. This is stated in the
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
(6.8):
na tasya kƒÅrya·πÅ kara·πáa·πÅ ca vidyate
na tat-sama≈õ cƒÅbhyadhika≈õ ca d·πõ≈õyate
The Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa, has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, His body, His mind and Himself. Foolish persons who do not perfectly know Him say that K·πõ·π£·πáa is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K·πõ·π£·πáa is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that although He does not have senses like ours, He can perform all sensory activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.
The knowledge, strength and activities of the Supreme Personality are all transcendental. As stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(4.9)
:

eva·πÅ yo vetti tattvata·∏•

Whoever knows K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn‚Äôt come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K·πõ·π£·πáa; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K·πõ·π£·πáa; everyone is His servant. The
Caitanya-caritƒÅm·πõta

K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs devotees relate to K·πõ·π£·πáa in various relationships; one might treat K·πõ·π£·πáa as a son, or one might treat K·πõ·π£·πáa as a husband, as a friend, or as a master. K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father tolerates, or the husband or a master tolerates, so K·πõ·π£·πáa tolerates."

After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.","Purport
Arjuna is always in confidence with K·πõ·π£·πáa because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend‚Äôs opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K·πõ·π£·πáa out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K·πõ·π£·πáa to show His NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa form, because He can assume any form. This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K·πõ·π£·πáa is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets. Of course in each Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planet the form of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa is four-handed, but the four hands hold different arrangements of symbols ‚Äì the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. According to the different hands these four things are held in, the NƒÅrƒÅya·πáas are variously named. All of these forms are one with K·πõ·π£·πáa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature."

But Arjuna knew that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, a spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms.

One who knows K·πõ·π£·πáa becomes free at once from all contamination of the material world."

Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, showed His universal form, full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing. K·πõ·π£·πáa showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K·πõ·π£·πáa through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They had not seen it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Someone has commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K·πõ·π£·πáa went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time K·πõ·π£·πáa manifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one had ever seen this form before."

The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi·π£·πáu are demigods (
vi·π£·πáu-bhakta·∏• sm·πõto daiva·∏•
). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi·π£·πáu, or who recognize only the impersonal part of K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K·πõ·π£·πáa and at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.
The
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
gives the description of the universal form. Although this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna, now one can have some idea of the
vi≈õva-r≈´pa
after this incident. Those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested in seeing the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa as Vi·π£·πáu, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.
In this verse there are some significant words, just like
veda-yaj√±ƒÅdhyayanai·∏•,
which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations.
Veda
refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, such as the four
Vedas
(
·πög, Yajur, SƒÅma
and
Atharva
) and the eighteen
PurƒÅ·πáas,
the
Upani·π£ads
and the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra.
One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are
s≈´tras ‚Äì Kalpa-s≈´tras
and
Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÅsƒÅ-s≈´tras
‚Äì for studying the method of sacrifice.
DƒÅnai·∏•
refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord ‚Äì the
brƒÅhma·πáas
and the Vai·π£·πáavas. Similarly, ‚Äúpious activities‚Äù refers to the
agni-hotra
and the prescribed duties of the different castes. And the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains is called
tapasya.
So one can perform all these ‚Äì can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the
Vedas,
etc. ‚Äì but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.
There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that it enables one to distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is unacceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations."

Arjuna was worried about killing Bhƒ´·π£ma and Dro·πáa, his worshipful grandfather and master. But K·πõ·π£·πáa said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When the sons of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra tried to disrobe Draupadƒ´ in the assembly of the Kurus, Bhƒ´·π£ma and Dro·πáa were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. K·πõ·π£·πáa showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K·πõ·π£·πáa showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. Either a devotee wants to offer his respectful worshipful feelings, or he wants to see the two-handed K·πõ·π£·πáa form so that he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

When K·πõ·π£·πáa appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devakƒ´, He first of all appeared as four-armed NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, K·πõ·π£·πáa knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form, but since Arjuna asked to see this four-handed form, K·πõ·π£·πáa also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form.

Saumya-vapu·∏•

In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many pious activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word
su-durdar≈õam
is used, indicating that K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge of
bhakti
one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form of K·πõ·π£·πáa with two hands is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like BrahmƒÅ and Lord ≈öiva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devakƒ´, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal ‚Äúsomething‚Äù within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures. K·πõ·π£·πáa in His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods like BrahmƒÅ and ≈öiva.
In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(9.11)
it is also confirmed,
avajƒÅnanti mƒÅ·πÅ m≈´·∏çhƒÅ mƒÅnu·π£ƒ´·πÅ tanum ƒÅ≈õritam:
He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs body, as confirmed by
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
and confirmed by K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K·πõ·π£·πáa by reading
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
or similar Vedic scriptures, K·πõ·π£·πáa is a problem. For one using a material process, K·πõ·π£·πáa is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher, but He is an ordinary man, and even though He was so powerful He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K·πõ·π£·πáa and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person. But the transcendental process is described in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
Chapter Four: to hear about K·πõ·π£·πáa from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K·πõ·π£·πáa from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K·πõ·π£·πáa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K·πõ·π£·πáa is covered by His
yoga-mƒÅyƒÅ
potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in the Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and by devotional service to K·πõ·π£·πáa, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K·πõ·π£·πáa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K·πõ·π£·πáa in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as ≈öyƒÅmasundara."

For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of grammatical knowledge or mere academic qualifications, K·πõ·π£·πáa is not possible to understand.

My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.","Purport
K·πõ·π£·πáa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K·πõ·π£·πáa or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the
Vedas
or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting on JanmƒÅ·π£·π≠amƒ´, the day on which K·πõ·π£·πáa appeared, and on the two days of EkƒÅda≈õƒ´ (the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K·πõ·π£·πáa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K·πõ·π£·πáa philosophy, or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, throughout the world. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is a benediction to humanity. Lord Caitanya was appreciated by R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ as the most munificent man of charity because love of K·πõ·π£·πáa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributing K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, that charity, given to spread K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Vi·π£·πáu or K·πõ·π£·πáa), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
6.23):
yasya deve parƒÅ bhaktir
yathƒÅ deve tathƒÅ gurau
tasyaite kathitƒÅ hy arthƒÅ·∏•
prakƒÅ≈õante mahƒÅtmana·∏•
One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master, in whom he has similar unflinching faith, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. One cannot understand K·πõ·π£·πáa by mental speculation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. The word
tu
is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa.
The personal forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are described as
su-durdar≈õam
, very difficult to see. They are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa and the two-handed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The words
tvad anyena na d·πõ·π£·π≠a-p≈´rvam
(verse 47) state that before Arjuna, no one had seen that universal form. Also, they suggest that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K·πõ·π£·πáa at the request of Arjuna so that in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.
The word
na,
used repeatedly in the previous verse, indicates that one should not be very much proud of such credentials as an academic education in Vedic literature. One must take to the devotional service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Only then can one attempt to write commentaries on
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
.
K·πõ·π£·πáa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is the origin of all emanations. K·πõ·π£·πáa is distinct even from these forms, what to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa (which is known as MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. As stated in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.48)
,

Therefore I worship Govinda, K·πõ·π£·πáa, the cause of all causes.‚Äù Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who has eternal bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi·π£·πáu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in

‚ÄúThe Supreme Absolute Truth is a person, His name is K·πõ·π£·πáa, and He sometimes descends on this earth.‚Äù Similarly, in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
we find a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in this list the name of K·πõ·π£·πáa also appears. But then it is said that this K·πõ·π£·πáa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (
ete cƒÅ·πÅ≈õa-kalƒÅ·∏• pu·πÅsa·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáas tu bhagavƒÅn svayam
).
Similarly, in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
the Lord says,
matta·∏• paratara·πÅ nƒÅnyat:
‚ÄúThere is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù He also says elsewhere in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, aham ƒÅdir hi devƒÅnƒÅm:
‚ÄúI am the origin of all the demigods.‚Äù And after understanding
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
from K·πõ·π£·πáa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words:
para·πÅ brahma para·πÅ dhƒÅma pavitra·πÅ parama·πÅ bhavƒÅn,
‚ÄúI now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.‚Äù Therefore the universal form which K·πõ·π£·πáa showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K·πõ·π£·πáa form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God‚Äôs original form.
The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K·πõ·π£·πáa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who was a constant companion of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service the two-handed form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is the most dear."

Anyone who wants to approach the supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K·πõ·π£·πáaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K·πõ·π£·πáa, must take this formula, as stated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the supreme spiritual personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.
As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious activities. As stated in the
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
(1.2.255),
anƒÅsaktasya vi·π£ayƒÅn
yathƒÅrham upayu√±jata·∏•
nirbandha·∏• k·πõ·π£·πáa-sambandhe
yukta·πÅ vairƒÅgyam ucyate
No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is called
k·πõ·π£·πáa-karma.
One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work; the result should be done only for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one has to do business for K·πõ·π£·πáa. If K·πõ·π£·πáa is the proprietor of the business, then K·πõ·π£·πáa should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K·πõ·π£·πáa, he can do it. This is work for K·πõ·π£·πáa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K·πõ·π£·πáa, and he can install the Deity of K·πõ·π£·πáa and arrange for the Deity‚Äôs service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all
k·πõ·π£·πáa-karma.
One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K·πõ·π£·πáa, and one should accept as
prasƒÅdam
the remnants of offerings to K·πõ·π£·πáa. If one constructs a very big building for K·πõ·π£·πáa and installs the Deity of K·πõ·π£·πáa, one is not prohibited from living there, but it is understood that the proprietor of the building is K·πõ·π£·πáa. That is called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K·πõ·π£·πáa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K·πõ·π£·πáa; that is also
k·πõ·π£·πáa-karma.
One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land ‚Äì in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land ‚Äì can utilize that for K·πõ·π£·πáa by growing flowers to offer Him. One can sow
tulasƒ´
plants, because
tulasƒ´
leaves are very important and K·πõ·π£·πáa has recommended this in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. Patra·πÅ pu·π£pa·πÅ phala·πÅ toyam.
K·πõ·π£·πáa desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or fruit, or a little water ‚Äì and by such an offering He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the
tulasƒ´.
So one can sow
tulasƒ´
and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K·πõ·π£·πáa.
The word
mat-parama·∏•
refers to one who considers the association of K·πõ·π£·πáa in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing
brahma-jyotir
effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K·πõ·π£·πáaloka, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word
mad-bhakta·∏•,
he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.
The term
sa·πÖga-varjita·∏•
is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K·πõ·π£·πáa. Not only are the atheistic persons against K·πõ·π£·πáa, but so also are those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in
Bhakti-rasƒÅm·πõta-sindhu
(1.1.11) as follows:
anyƒÅbhilƒÅ·π£itƒÅ-≈õ≈´nya·πÅ
j√±ƒÅna-karmƒÅdy-anƒÅv·πõtam
ƒÅnuk≈´lyena k·πõ·π£·πáƒÅnu-
≈õƒ´lana·πÅ bhaktir uttamƒÅ
In this verse ≈örƒ´la R≈´pa GosvƒÅmƒ´ clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa, that is called pure devotional service.
ƒÄnuk≈´lyasya sa·πÖkalpa·∏• prƒÅtik≈´lyasya varjanam
(
Hari-bhakti-vilƒÅsa
11.676). One should think of K·πõ·π£·πáa and act for K·πõ·π£·πáa favorably, not unfavorably. Ka·πÅsa was an enemy of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs. From the very beginning of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs birth, Ka·πÅsa planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious in every respect, but that K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K·πõ·π£·πáa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K·πõ·π£·πáa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K·πõ·π£·πáa attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. His only objective is to serve K·πõ·π£·πáa wherever he may be.
A devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy (
nirvaira·∏•
). How is this? A devotee situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness knows that only devotional service to K·πõ·π£·πáa can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord who risked their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He was crucified by the nondevotees, but he sacrificed his life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that he was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as ·π¨hƒÅkura HaridƒÅsa and PrahlƒÅda MahƒÅrƒÅja. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and it is difficult. A K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious person knows that if a man is suffering it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one‚Äôs neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K·πõ·π£·πáa is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.
In summary, the universal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi·π£·πáu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus K·πõ·π£·πáa is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K·πõ·π£·πáa is a manifestation of the original
vi≈õva-r≈´pa,
or Vi·π£·πáu. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi·π£·πáus, but for a devotee no form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is important but the original form, two-handed ≈öyƒÅmasundara. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
it is stated that those who are attached to the ≈öyƒÅmasundara form of K·πõ·π£·πáa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is essential and supreme.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of the Universal Form."

Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?","Purport
K·πõ·π£·πáa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and
yogƒ´s
. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist also engages himself, not directly in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.
We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth,
bhakti-yoga,
devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.
Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K·πõ·π£·πáa indicates in this chapter that
bhakti-yoga,
or devotional service to Him, is the highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.
In the Second Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Supreme Lord explained that a living entity is not the material body; he is a spiritual spark. And the Absolute Truth is the spiritual whole. In the Seventh Chapter He spoke of the living entity as being part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommended that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. Then again in the Eighth Chapter it was said that anyone who thinks of K·πõ·π£·πáa at the time of quitting his body is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, to the abode of K·πõ·π£·πáa. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord clearly said that of all
yogƒ´s,
one who always thinks of K·πõ·π£·πáa within himself is considered the most perfect. So in practically every chapter the conclusion has been that one should be attached to the personal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa, for that is the highest spiritual realization.
Nevertheless, there are those who are not attached to the personal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. They are so firmly detached that even in the preparation of commentaries to
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
they want to distract other people from K·πõ·π£·πáa and transfer all devotion to the impersonal
brahma-jyotir
. They prefer to meditate on the impersonal form of the Absolute Truth, which is beyond the reach of the senses and is not manifest.
And so, factually, there are two classes of transcendentalists. Now Arjuna is trying to settle the question of which process is easier and which of the classes is most perfect. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, ‚ÄúWhat is the use of such a waste of time?‚Äù Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K·πõ·π£·πáa is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K·πõ·π£·πáa. This important question asked of K·πõ·π£·πáa by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth."

In answer to Arjuna‚Äôs question, K·πõ·π£·πáa clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in
yoga.
For one in such K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness there are no material activities, because everything is done for K·πõ·π£·πáa. A pure devotee is constantly engaged. Sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about K·πõ·π£·πáa, or sometimes he cooks
prasƒÅdam
or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for K·πõ·π£·πáa, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes ‚Äì whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to K·πõ·π£·πáa. Such action is in full

For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.","Purport
The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called
j√±ƒÅna-yogƒ´s,
and persons who are in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called
bhakti-yogƒ´s.
Now, here the difference between
j√±ƒÅna-yoga
and
bhakti-yoga
is definitely expressed. The process of
j√±ƒÅna-yoga,
although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of
bhakti-yoga,
the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the
bhakti-yogƒ´
accepts the Deity of K·πõ·π£·πáa as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be
sagu·πáa
or
nirgu·πáa
‚Äì of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is
sagu·πáa
worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.
A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation which we may find somewhere but which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called
arcƒÅ-vigraha.
This
arcƒÅ-vigraha
is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent, all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as
arcƒÅ-vigraha
He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.
So for a devotee there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the
Upani·π£ads,
and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly. A similar passage appears in
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam.
It is stated there that if one ultimately has to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (this surrendering process is called
bhakti
), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization, because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.
A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of
j√±ƒÅna-yoga,
may come to the point of
bhakti-yoga,
or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independent, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual, blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus the process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa."

The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee.

My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way develop a desire to attain Me.","Purport
In this verse, two different processes of
bhakti-yoga
are indicated. The first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K·πõ·π£·πáa.
Bhakti-yoga
is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But by the practice of
bhakti-yoga
these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don‚Äôt really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.
This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone‚Äôs heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by material association. Now the heart has to be purified of the material association, and that dormant, natural love for K·πõ·π£·πáa has to be revived. That is the whole process.
To practice the regulative principles of
bhakti-yoga
one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take
prasƒÅdam,
and so on. There are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
from pure devotees. This practice can help anyone rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of
bhakti-yoga,
under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God."

under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles of
bhakti-yoga,
he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect."

It may be that one is unable even to sympathize with the activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions for the full-moon day, and there is special work in which the result of one‚Äôs previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one‚Äôs activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Of course, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is not dependent on any other experience, because K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness itself can purify one‚Äôs mind, but if there are impediments to accepting K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one‚Äôs country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(18.46)
we find it is stated,
yata·∏• prav·πõttir bh≈´tƒÅnƒÅm:
if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is K·πõ·π£·πáa, he will come gradually to understand that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method."

If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind.","Purport
As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulative principles and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness it is better to cultivate knowledge, because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process. In the cultivation of knowledge there are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the
brƒÅhma·πáas, k·π£atriyas, vai≈õyas
and
≈õ≈´dras,
which we shall find in the last chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of
karma
for some good cause.
In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one‚Äôs activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may take either the step-by-step process or the direct path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna, because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others, who are not at this stage; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa."

A few of a devotee‚Äôs qualifications are further being described. No one is put into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness or dissatisfaction by such a devotee. Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way as to put others into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and engaged in devotional service, such material circumstances cannot move him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn‚Äôt, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. A devotee who is always transcendental to all these disturbances is very dear to K·πõ·π£·πáa."

Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not agitated. Naturally a devotee takes a bath at least twice in a day and rises early in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the essence of all activities of life and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He is never pained, because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations."

If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to K·πõ·π£·πáa."

(‚Äúthis religion of eternal engagement‚Äù) ‚Äì the Supreme Lord has explained the processes of transcendental service for approaching Him. Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better ‚Äì one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead ‚Äì was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of Devotional Service."

O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is My opinion.","Purport
While discussing the subject of the body and the knower of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa says, ‚ÄúI am also the knower, but I am not the individual knower of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, or Supersoul.‚Äù
One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
can attain to knowledge.
The Lord says, ‚ÄúI am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.‚Äù The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.
The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa, which means ‚Äúthe controller of the senses.‚Äù He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state; the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord says, ‚ÄúI am also the knower.‚Äù This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:
k·π£etrƒÅ·πái hi ≈õarƒ´rƒÅ·πái
bƒ´ja·πÅ cƒÅpi ≈õubhƒÅ≈õubhe
tƒÅni vetti sa yogƒÅtmƒÅ
tata·∏• k·π£etra-j√±a ucyate
This body is called the
k·π£etra,
and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the knower of activities, and the supreme knower of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as
j√±ƒÅna.
That is the opinion of K·πõ·π£·πáa. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of
prak·πõti
(nature),
puru·π£a
(the enjoyer of nature) and
ƒ´≈õvara
(the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language (in the
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
1.12),
bhoktƒÅ bhogya·πÅ preritƒÅra·πÅ ca matvƒÅ/ sarva·πÅ prokta·πÅ tri-vidha·πÅ brahmam etat.
There are three Brahman conceptions:
prak·πõti
is Brahman as the field of activities, and the
jƒ´va
(individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.
In this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly, ‚ÄúI am also the knower of the field of activity.‚Äù One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity for lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word
ca
is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of ≈örƒ´la Baladeva VidyƒÅbh≈´·π£a·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul. And K·πõ·π£·πáa explicitly says here that real knowledge is to know that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer."

The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the individual soul is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One should also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul, their different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body to be one with the individual soul, the
jƒ´va.
This is something like equating the potent and the impotent."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K·πõ·π£·πáa is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and nonduality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to a scripture, the
VedƒÅnta,
which is accepted as authority. First He says, ‚ÄúThis is according to different sages.‚Äù As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, VyƒÅsadeva (the author of the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
) is a great sage, and in the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
duality is perfectly explained. And VyƒÅsadeva‚Äôs father, ParƒÅ≈õara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity,
aham tva·πÅ ca tathƒÅnye.‚Ä¶
‚Äúwe ‚Äì you, I and the various other living entities ‚Äì are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different
karma.
As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.‚Äù Similarly, in the original
Vedas,
a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad.
There are many great sages who have explained this, and ParƒÅ≈õara is considered principal among them.
The word
chandobhi·∏•
refers to the various Vedic literatures. The
Taittirƒ´ya Upani·π£ad,
for example, which is a branch of the
Yajur Veda,
describes nature, the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
As stated before,
k·π£etra
is the field of activities, and there are two kinds of
k·π£etra-j√±a:
the individual living entity and the supreme living entity. As stated in the
Taittirƒ´ya Upani·π£ad
(2.5),
brahma puccha·πÅ prati·π£·π≠hƒÅ.
There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord‚Äôs energy known as
anna-maya,
dependence upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then, in
prƒÅ·πáa-maya,
after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in food, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms or life forms. In
j√±ƒÅna-maya,
realization extends beyond the living symptoms to the point of thinking, feeling and willing. Then there is Brahman realization, called
vij√±ƒÅna-maya,
in which the living entity‚Äôs mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself. The next and supreme stage is
ƒÅnanda-maya,
realization of the all-blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which are called
brahma puccham.
Out of these, the first three ‚Äì
anna-maya, prƒÅ·πáa-maya
and
j√±ƒÅna-maya
‚Äì involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called
ƒÅnanda-maya.
The
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
also describes the Supreme by saying,
ƒÅnanda-mayo ‚ÄôbhyƒÅsƒÅt:
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy. To enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into
vij√±ƒÅna-maya, prƒÅ·πáa-maya, j√±ƒÅna-maya
and
anna-maya.
In the field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the
ƒÅnanda-maya.
That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy in dovetailing himself with the
ƒÅnanda-maya,
then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord as the supreme knower of the field, the living entity as the subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities. One has to search for this truth in the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra,
or
Brahma-s≈´tra.
It is mentioned here that the codes of the
Brahma-s≈´tra
are very nicely arranged according to cause and effect. Some of the
s≈´tras,
or aphorisms, are
na viyad a≈õrute·∏•
(2.3.2),
nƒÅtmƒÅ ≈õrute·∏•
(2.3.18), and
parƒÅt tu tac-chrute·∏•
(2.3.40). The first aphorism indicates the field of activities, the second indicates the living entity, and the third indicates the Supreme Lord, the
summum bonum
among all the manifestations of various entities."

I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. Brahman, the spirit, beginningless and subordinate to Me, lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.","Purport
The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities. Now He begins to explain the knowable, first the soul and then the Supersoul. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the
jƒ´va
was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of the
jƒ´vƒÅtmƒÅ‚Äôs
manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this:
na jƒÅyate mriyate vƒÅ vipa≈õcit
(
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
1.2.18). The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge.
The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is also stated in the Vedic literature (
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
6.16) to be
pradhƒÅna-k·π£etraj√±a-patir gu·πáe≈õa·∏•,
the chief knower of the body and the master of the three modes of material nature. In the
sm·πõti
it is said,
dƒÅsa-bh≈´to harer eva nƒÅnyasvaiva kadƒÅcana.
The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teachings. Therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is
vij√±ƒÅna-brahma
as opposed to
ƒÅnanda-brahma. ƒÄnanda-brahma
is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead."

As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher, BrahmƒÅ, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
(5.37)
it is stated,
goloka eva nivasaty akhilƒÅtma-bh≈´ta·∏•:
although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul."

The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities, doesn‚Äôt have material senses like they have.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes ‚Äì otherwise how could He see? He sees everything ‚Äì past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ:
He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy, because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form, called
sac-cid-ƒÅnanda-vigraha.
He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activity. As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation we can see the Lord‚Äôs form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists, who are still materially affected, cannot understand the Personality of Godhead."

The Lord is situated in everyone‚Äôs heart as the Supersoul. Does this mean that He has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun: The sun, at the meridian, is situated in its place. But if one goes for five thousand miles in all directions and asks, ‚ÄúWhere is the sun?‚Äù everyone will say that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is said in Vedic literature that one Vi·π£·πáu is present everywhere by His omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the Lord said that He had come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruk·π£etra. He also mentioned that in the form of time He devours also. He is the annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from their original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest of all. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after annihilation everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the confirmations of Vedic hymns.

The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all luminous objects like the sun, moon and stars. In the Vedic literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon, because the effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that
brahma-jyotir,
the Lord‚Äôs spiritual effulgence, is covered by the
mahat-tattva,
the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world, which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature.

His knowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord, who is situated in everyone‚Äôs heart. One Vedic
mantra
(

6.18) says,
ta·πÅ ha devam ƒÅtma-buddhi-prakƒÅ≈õa·πÅ mumuk·π£ur vai ≈õara·πáam aha·πÅ prapadye.
One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature:
tam eva viditvƒÅti m·πõtyum eti.
‚ÄúOnly by knowing Him can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.‚Äù (
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
3.8)
He is situated in everyone‚Äôs heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity ‚Äì the individual soul and the Supersoul ‚Äì must be admitted. One‚Äôs hands and legs are distributed locally, but K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs hands and legs are distributed everywhere. This is confirmed in the
≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad
(3.17):

That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the
prabhu,
or master, of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate shelter of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different."

Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge and the knowable have been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly and thus attain to My nature.","Purport
The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of knowing. Combined, these are called
vij√±ƒÅna,
or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs activities and realize that K·πõ·π£·πáa is everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained.
Now, to summarize, one may understand that verses 6 and 7, beginning from
mahƒÅ-bh≈´tƒÅni
and continuing through
cetanƒÅ dh·πõti·∏•,
analyze the material elements and certain manifestations of the symptoms of life. These combine to form the body, or the field of activities. And verses 8 through 12, from
amƒÅnitvam
through
tattva-j√±ƒÅnƒÅrtha-dar≈õanam,
describe the process of knowledge for understanding both types of knower of the field of activities, namely the soul and the Supersoul. Then verses 13 through 18, beginning from
anƒÅdi mat-param
and continuing through
h·πõdi sarvasya vi·π£·π≠hitam,
describe the soul and the Supreme Lord, or the Supersoul.
Thus three items have been described: the field of activity (the body), the process of understanding, and both the soul and the Supersoul. It is especially described here that only the unalloyed devotees of the Lord can understand these three items clearly. So for these devotees
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is fully useful; it is they who can attain the supreme goal, the nature of the Supreme Lord, K·πõ·π£·πáa. In other words, only devotees, and not others, can understand
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and derive the desired result."

Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.","Purport
By the knowledge given in this chapter, one can understand the body (the field of activities) and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul). The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. The individual soul that is embodied and enjoying the activities of the body is the
puru·π£a,
or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.
Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord, and so also are the living entities, but the living entities are of the superior energy. Both the living entities and material nature existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, MahƒÅ-vi·π£·πáu, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of the
mahat-tattva.
Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are averse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky. But with the coming forth of material nature these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same."

Nature is said to be the cause of all material causes and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.","Purport
The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total ‚Äì body and instrument senses ‚Äì is offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one‚Äôs desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the
Vedas
(
Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad
3.1.1) as follows:
dvƒÅ supar·πáƒÅ sayujƒÅ sakhƒÅya·∏•.
The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, or ParamƒÅtmƒÅ."

The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.","Purport
This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.
How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Unless one is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K·πõ·π£·πáa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic
mantra
it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life."

Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer, who is the Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known as the Supersoul.","Purport
It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is
para,
transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, not
ƒÅtmƒÅ,
and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the
ƒÅtmƒÅ
and ParamƒÅtmƒÅ are different. The Supersoul, the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul‚Äôs desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is
bhukta,
or the sustained, and the Lord is
bhoktƒÅ,
or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.
The fact is that every individual living entity is eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independently in an attempt to dominate nature, and because he has this tendency he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or in the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
and from within He tries to convince the living entity that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. ‚ÄúJust give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy,‚Äù He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge."

This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material existence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then revert to spiritual consciousness or K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness by understanding
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ

Some perceive the Supersoul within themselves through meditation, others through the cultivation of knowledge, and still others through working without fruitive desires.","Purport
The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned souls can be divided into two classes as far as man‚Äôs search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others, who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called introspective devotees, philosophers, and workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best situated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this material nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is expanded as the ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the class of the faithful. The SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the

This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home."

This body is made by material nature under the direction of the Supersoul, and whatever activities are going on in respect to one‚Äôs body are not his doing. Whatever one is supposed to do, either for happiness or for distress, one is forced to do because of the bodily constitution. The self, however, is outside all these bodily activities. This body is given according to one‚Äôs past desires. To fulfill desires, one is given the body, with which he acts accordingly. Practically speaking, the body is a machine, designed by the Supreme Lord, to fulfill desires. Because of desires, one is put into difficult circumstances to suffer or to enjoy. This transcendental vision of the living entity, when developed, makes one separate from bodily activities. One who has such a vision is an actual seer."

When a sensible man ceases to see different identities due to different material bodies and he sees how beings are expanded everywhere, he attains to the Brahman conception.","Purport
When one can see that the various bodies of living entities arise due to the different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to the soul itself, one actually sees. In the material conception of life, we find someone a demigod, someone a human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is material vision, not actual vision. This material differentiation is due to a material conception of life. After the destruction of the material body, the spirit soul is one. The spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of bodies. When one can see this, he attains spiritual vision; thus being freed from differentiations like man, animal, big, low, etc., one becomes purified in his consciousness and able to develop K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in his spiritual identity. How he then sees things will be explained in the next verse."

A living entity appears to be born because of the birth of the material body, but actually the living entity is eternal; he is not born, and in spite of his being situated in a material body, he is transcendental and eternal.

He does not engage himself in any material activities; therefore the activities performed due to his contact with material bodies do not entangle him."

O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.","Purport
There are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
the example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one place but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body there is no more consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a product of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme, because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness."

Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal.","Purport
The purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. One should recognize the process of liberation, as described in verses 8 through 12. Then one can go on to the supreme destination.
A faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, one can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the stepping-stone for further spiritual realization. A spiritual master, by various instructions, teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life. For instance, in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
we find K·πõ·π£·πáa instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations.
One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements. The body is the gross manifestation. And the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and can also see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer and Consciousness."

Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attained perfection and transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attained perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection."

By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature like My own. Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation or disturbed at the time of dissolution.","Purport
After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the repetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an individual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving service. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual identities.
Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature. Knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as the Supreme Person. Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, in the spiritual world there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains a spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities. One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or by the destruction of the material world."

The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.","Purport
This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of
k·π£etra
and
k·π£etra-j√±a,
the body and the spirit soul. This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself. The
mahat-tattva
is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation; and that total substance of the material cause, in which there are three modes of nature, is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material substance, the
mahat-tattva,
is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature (
Mu·πá·∏çaka Upani·π£ad
1.1.19):
tasmƒÅd etad brahma nƒÅma-r≈´pam anna·πÅ ca jƒÅyate.
The Supreme Person impregnates that Brahman with the seeds of the living entities. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, and they constitute what is called
mahad brahma,
or the great Brahman, the material nature. As explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature ‚Äì the living entity. Into material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.
The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, so that the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world."

The living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living entities are seen not only on this planet but on every planet, even on the highest, where BrahmƒÅ is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs seed-giving process.

Still, because he has become conditioned by the material world, he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress."

O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that mode become conditioned by a sense of happiness and knowledge.","Purport
The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities‚Äô conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the
brƒÅhma·πáa,
who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.
The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and the philosopher. Each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly one may become a philosopher, a scientist or a poet, and repeatedly become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant."

The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kuntƒ´, and because of this the embodied living entity is bound to material fruitive actions.","Purport
The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what to speak of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?"

O son of Bharata, know that the mode of darkness, born of ignorance, is the delusion of all embodied living entities. The results of this mode are madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.","Purport
In this verse the specific application of the word
tu
is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature.
Vastu-yƒÅthƒÅtmya-j√±ƒÅnƒÅvaraka·πÅ viparyaya-j√±ƒÅna-janaka·πÅ tama·∏•:
under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand a thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance."

A man in the mode of passion may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open hospitals, give to charity institutions, etc. These are signs of one in the mode of passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge.

But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance. Or one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is determined he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and by transcending the mode of goodness he can be situated in pure goodness, which is called the

The result of pious action is pure and is said to be in the mode of goodness. But action done in the mode of passion results in misery, and action performed in the mode of ignorance results in foolishness.","Purport
The result of pious activities in the mode of goodness is pure. Therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. But activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness ‚Äì ‚ÄúI have this house or this money‚Äù ‚Äì but this is not actual happiness.
As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy,
mƒÅyƒÅ,
the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is a son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant‚Äôs being killed. One has to pay for it. So indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals, because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature (
·πög Veda
9.46.4) the words
gobhi·∏• prƒ´·πáita-matsaram
indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:
namo brahma·πáya-devƒÅya

It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger."

From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, greed develops; and from the mode of ignorance develop foolishness, madness and illusion.","Purport
Since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is recommended. Through K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, society will develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking the chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and prosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren‚Äôt happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangements for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible, because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. When one is engaged in the mode of passion, not only is he mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future in life is very dark."

Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the abominable mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.","Purport
In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord BrahmƒÅ, resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this.
The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the mode of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life.
The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life ‚Äì birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc. ‚Äì and according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions. The word
tƒÅmasƒÅ·∏•

TƒÅmasƒÅ·∏•
indicates those who stay continuously in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their future is very dark.
There is an opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity will certainly continue in the lower modes."

One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real spiritual master is K·πõ·π£·πáa, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one‚Äôs life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he can become fixed in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. A man in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to K·πõ·π£·πáa is relieved from the activities of material nature. For one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases."

He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature.

One who engages in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.","Purport
This verse is a reply to Arjuna‚Äôs third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K·πõ·π£·πáa activities. K·πõ·π£·πáa activities are known as
bhakti-yoga
‚Äì always acting for K·πõ·π£·πáa. This includes not only K·πõ·π£·πáa, but His different plenary expansions such as RƒÅma and NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K·πõ·π£·πáa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service of K·πõ·π£·πáa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome them easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K·πõ·π£·πáa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality with K·πõ·π£·πáa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good as K·πõ·π£·πáa in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question of
bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga
means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there, and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning to
bhakti-yoga
. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature,
brahmaiva san brahmƒÅpy eti
. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as an individual soul."

And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is immortal, imperishable and eternal and is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness.","Purport
The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to ParamƒÅtmƒÅ realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four KumƒÅras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said,
raso vai sa·∏•, rasa·πÅ hy evƒÅya·πÅ labdhvƒÅnandƒ´ bhavati:
‚ÄúWhen one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure, K·πõ·π£·πáa, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.‚Äù (
Taittirƒ´ya Upani·π£ad
2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.
The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature ‚Äì goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service, beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering ‚Äì the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service ‚Äì should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one‚Äôs material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord‚Äôs transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the
brahma-jyotir
or the different varieties of the Brahman conception is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourteenth Chapter of the

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: It is said that there is an imperishable banyan tree that has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.","Purport
After the discussion of the importance of
bhakti-yoga,
one may question, ‚ÄúWhat about the
Vedas
?‚Äù It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. Therefore one who is in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the
Vedas.
The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree‚Äôs roots grow upward because they begin from where BrahmƒÅ is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.
This process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. The root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities‚Äô activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.
Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as a tree‚Äôs reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things‚Äô being situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it.
This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahman to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy, come
prak·πõti, puru·π£a,
then the three
gu·πáas,
then the five gross elements (
pa√±ca-mahƒÅ-bh≈´ta
), then the ten senses (
da≈õendriya
), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world into twenty-four elements. If Brahman is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The
prak·πõti
is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the
puru·π£a
is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person knows the
Vedas,
it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the
Vedas.
One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the
Vedas
is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know the purpose of the
Vedas.
The purpose of the
Vedas,
as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world."

The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.","Purport
The description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated manifestations of living entities ‚Äì human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature. Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where particular modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested accordingly.
The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of the different modes of nature we develop different senses, and by the senses we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The tips of the branches are the senses ‚Äì the ears, nose, eyes, etc. ‚Äì which are attached to the enjoyment of different sense objects. The twigs are sound, form, touch, and so on ‚Äì the sense objects. The subsidiary roots are attachments and aversions, which are by-products of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to develop from these secondary roots, which spread in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka, and the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to this earth and renews his
karma,
or fruitive activities for promotion. This planet of human beings is considered the field of activities."

The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

That supreme abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by fire or electricity. Those who reach it never return to this material world.","Purport
The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì which is known as K·πõ·π£·πáaloka, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana ‚Äì is described here. In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaiku·πá·π≠has) constitutes the shining sky known as the
brahma-jyotir.
Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of K·πõ·π£·πáa, Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana. Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the
mahat-tattva,
the material world. Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaiku·πá·π≠has, chief of which is Goloka V·πõndƒÅvana.
As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.
One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.
The words
parama·πÅ mama
are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is
paramam,
full of six opulences. The
Ka·π≠ha Upani·π£ad
(2.2.15) also confirms that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine, moonshine or stars (
na tatra s≈´ryo bhƒÅti na candra-tƒÅrakam
), for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord. That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means."

By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord RƒÅma, N·πõsi·πÅha-deva, Vi·π£·πáum≈´rti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaiku·πá·π≠ha planets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.
The living entities, not only human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world ‚Äì BrahmƒÅ, Lord ≈öiva and even Vi·π£·πáu ‚Äì are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word
kar·π£ati
(‚Äústruggling‚Äù or ‚Äúgrappling hard‚Äù) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests itself in its individual capacity. The following information is there in the
MƒÅdhyandinƒÅyana-≈õruti: sa vƒÅ e·π£a brahma-ni·π£·π≠ha ida·πÅ ≈õarƒ´ra·πÅ martyam atis·πõjya brahmƒÅbhisampadya brahma·πáƒÅ pa≈õyati brahma·πáƒÅ ≈õ·πõ·πáoti brahma·πáaiveda·πÅ sarvam anubhavati.
It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. From
sm·πõti
also it is understood,
vasanti yatra puru·π£ƒÅ·∏• sarve vaiku·πá·π≠ha-m≈´rtaya·∏•:
in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead‚Äôs. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part-and-parcel living entities and the expansions of
vi·π£·πáu-m≈´rti.
In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The words
mamaivƒÅ·πÅ≈õa·∏•
(‚Äúfragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord‚Äù) are also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter, which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here, because the Sanskrit word
sanƒÅtana
(‚Äúeternal‚Äù) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that in each and every individual body the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present (
dehino ‚Äôsmin yathƒÅ dehe
). That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one with the Lord, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold."

The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another, as the air carries aromas. Thus he takes one kind of body and again quits it to take another.","Purport
Here the living entity is described as
ƒ´≈õvara,
the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat‚Äôs or dog‚Äôs body. And if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will change into the form of a demigod. And if he is in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he will be transferred to K·πõ·π£·πáaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with K·πõ·π£·πáa. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to
karma,
and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called
kar·π£ati,
or struggle for existence."

In other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and enjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the material qualities. Real consciousness is K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. When, therefore, one is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body again; he can get the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other forms, for there are 8,400,000 species."

Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances, he is living under certain circumstances, and he is enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power to understand their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They should come out of it and be K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the spiritual world."

The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.","Purport
The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. But one can begin to be established in knowledge by understanding what the Lord explains here. Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home.
From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also, but in each universe there is only one sun. As stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(10.21)
, the moon is one of the stars (
nak·π£atrƒÅ·πáƒÅm aha·πÅ ≈õa≈õƒ´
). Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff, they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, then one‚Äôs K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are some thoughts to provoke K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in the conditioned soul."

It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet and every living being. That is discussed in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ.
It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, the body sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust‚Äôs falling, but if one throws it in the air it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and nonmoving things stay in their place. It is said in the Vedic hymns that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon‚Äôs influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word
rasƒÅtmaka·∏•
is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon."

According to ƒÄyur-vedic

we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order we become hungry. Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras (
B·πõhad-ƒÅra·πáyaka Upani·π£ad
5.9.1) also confirm that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff (
ayam agnir vai≈õvƒÅnaro yo ‚Äôyam anta·∏• puru·π£e yenedam anna·πÅ pacyate
). Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independent in the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and by His grace we are enjoying life. In the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
(1.2.27) this is also confirmed.

The Supreme Lord is situated as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ in everyone‚Äôs heart, and it is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is worshipable not only as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, but as the form of the incarnation of the
Vedas
as well. The
Vedas
give the right direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The
Vedas
offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, and K·πõ·π£·πáa in His incarnation as VyƒÅsadeva is the compiler of the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra.
The commentation on the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
by VyƒÅsadeva in the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
gives the real understanding of
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra.
The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of the
Vedas
and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, the teacher of the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.
Anta·∏•-pravi·π£·π≠a·∏• ≈õƒÅstƒÅ janƒÅnƒÅm.
The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand the
Vedas
from Him. If one is serious about understanding the Vedic knowledge, then K·πõ·π£·πáa gives the required intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. Vedic literature confirms this:
yo ‚Äôsau sarvair vedair gƒ´yate.
In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four
Vedas, VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
and the
Upani·π£ads
and
PurƒÅ·πáas,
the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performance of Vedic rituals, discussion of the Vedic philosophy and worship of the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the
Vedas
is to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. The
Vedas
give us direction by which to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa and the process of realizing Him. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
(1.1.4) confirms this in the following words:
tat tu samanvayƒÅt.
One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse the purpose of the
Vedas,
the understanding of the
Vedas,
and the goal of the
Vedas
are clearly defined."

VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra.
Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra.
He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes ‚Äì the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world they are called
jƒ´va-bh≈´ta,
and the Sanskrit words given here,
k·π£ara·∏• sarvƒÅ·πái bh≈´tƒÅni,
mean that they are fallible. Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as stated in the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra,
is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.
According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, there are two classes of living entities. The
Vedas
give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses have their material bodies, which are changing. As long as a living entity is conditioned, his body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes ‚Äì birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness.
K·π£ara·∏• sarvƒÅ·πái bh≈´tƒÅni:
any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, BrahmƒÅ, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness."

Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority between their personalities. The word

There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa to be the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.
Vedic knowledge is called
≈õruti,
learning by aural reception. One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K·πõ·π£·πáa and His representatives. Here K·πõ·π£·πáa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, knows the purpose of the
Vedas;
no one else knows the purpose of the
Vedas.
The word
bhajati
is very significant. In many places the word
bhajati
is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, in the devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai·π£·πáava
paramparƒÅ
it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K·πõ·π£·πáa, then there is no need for any other spiritual process for understanding the Supreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the point, because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding. But if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K·πõ·π£·πáa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time."

This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.","Purport
The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.
Everyone must take to this consciousness of K·πõ·π£·πáa and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of understanding K·πõ·π£·πáa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.
The word
anagha,
by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant.
Anagha,
‚ÄúO sinless one,‚Äù means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.
While one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the first five verses describe the process of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the chapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses
puru·π£ottama-yoga.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifteenth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of
Puru·π£ottama-yoga,
the
Yoga
of the Supreme Person."

In this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and demand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities."

Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac, because he was considering the pros and cons. He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bhƒ´·π£ma and Dro·πáa should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige or harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For a
k·π£atriya,
a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the regulative principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated."

Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the PrajƒÅpati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not."

Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.","Purport
In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which is followed from the beginning. Especially among the ƒÄryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples, those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally. One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, shaving, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare K·πõ·π£·πáa, K·πõ·π£·πáa K·πõ·π£·πáa, Hare Hare/ Hare RƒÅma, Hare RƒÅma, RƒÅma RƒÅma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.
As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the
Manu-sa·πÅhitƒÅ,
which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the
Manu-sa·πÅhitƒÅ.
Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the
Manu-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the
Manu-sa·πÅhitƒÅ.
But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. The social condition of women is thus not very good now, although those who are married are in a better condition than those who are proclaiming their so-called freedom. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable."

The demonic conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause and effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance, just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence. Then when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of K·πõ·π£·πáa in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, mayƒÅdhyak·π£e·πáa prak·πõti·∏• s≈´yate sa-carƒÅcaram:

Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world."

Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things ‚Äì sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word
a≈õuci-vratƒÅ·∏•,
‚Äúunclean vows,‚Äù is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat-eating; those are their

unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, by artificial means the world creates a false honor for them.

The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is unlimited. He thinks only of how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth further and further. For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification. He is enamored by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of
karma.
According to the law of
karma,
a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac think that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of one‚Äôs personal ability. They do not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep ‚Äì between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.
Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: ‚ÄúWhy are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don‚Äôt believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.‚Äù These are the demoniac‚Äôs preachings.
Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than he and that no one is more influential than he. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing
yaj√±as,
or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of
yaj√±a
and prepare some machine by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was RƒÅva·πáa. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the
Vedas.
Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangements. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell. Here the Sanskrit word
moha-jƒÅla
is very significant.

means ‚Äúnet‚Äù; like fish caught in a net, they have no way to come out."

Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one‚Äôs own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word
avidhi-p≈´rvakam,
meaning a disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion."

Not knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead, because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false arguments against the existence of God and denies the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independent and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in strength, power or wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop him.

The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life ‚Äì animals, insects, men, and so on. All are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac species of men are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean. The many kinds of hunters in the jungle are considered to belong to the demoniac species of life."

It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the
Vedas
also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the
asuras,
the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the
asuras
are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many
asuras
‚Äì RƒÅva·πáa, Ka·πÅsa, Hira·πáyaka≈õipu ‚Äì to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill them. Therefore God‚Äôs mercy is shown to the

If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification. The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. By cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual order system.

In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. And even if he accepts the existence of God, if he does not engage himself in the service of the Lord his attempts are spoiled.

Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life.

Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the
Vedas
. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called following the principles of
≈õƒÅstra,
or scripture.
≈öƒÅstra
is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the
≈õƒÅstra
‚Äì being above these defects ‚Äì are accepted without alteration by all great saints,
ƒÅcƒÅryas
and great souls.
In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the
Vedas
. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the
≈õƒÅstras
is considered fortunate.
In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore,
mƒÅyƒÅ,
the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one‚Äôs life becomes successful.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures."

In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an
asura,
demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a
deva,
or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna‚Äôs is to be cleared by K·πõ·π£·πáa. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to K·πõ·π£·πáa."

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: According to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one‚Äôs faith can be of three kinds ‚Äì in goodness, in passion or in ignorance. Now hear about this.","Purport
Those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures but out of laziness or indolence give up following these rules and regulations are governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the mode of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually; since the living entity is in contact with material nature, he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature."

O son of Bharata, according to one‚Äôs existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired.","Purport
Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, originally he is
nirgu·πáa,
or transcendental. Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired, in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If one is situated in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.
The word
≈õraddhƒÅ,
or ‚Äúfaith,‚Äù is very significant in this verse.
≈öraddhƒÅ,
or faith, originally comes out of the mode of goodness. One‚Äôs faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. One‚Äôs strong faith is supposed to be productive of works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one‚Äôs faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one‚Äôs faith is established. It should be understood that if one‚Äôs heart is in the mode of goodness his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship."

Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.","Purport
In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods include BrahmƒÅ, ≈öiva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.
Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have seen that in India the lower-class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
(4.3.23)
it is said,
sattva·πÅ vi≈õuddha·πÅ vasudeva-≈õabditam:
‚ÄúWhen a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships VƒÅsudeva.‚Äù The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi·π£·πáu form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi·π£·πáu. Vi·π£·πáu is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi·π£·πáu form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord BrahmƒÅ is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature."

They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or food or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in general."

Food prepared more than three hours before being eaten, food that is tasteless, decomposed and putrid, and food consisting of remnants and untouchable things is dear to those in the mode of darkness.","Purport
The purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life‚Äôs duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas,
dƒÅl,
whole wheat, etc.
Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by reducing the mucus in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except
prasƒÅdam,
food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.
Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnants of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion.
Patra·πÅ pu·π£pa·πÅ phala·πÅ toyam.
Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the
prasƒÅdam
should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunctions of the scripture and offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables without any purpose of obtaining material benefit. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunctions. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the mode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should be given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunctions. He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy.

Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to those who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. The process of speaking in spiritual circles is to say something upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech."

And satisfaction, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purification of one‚Äôs existence are the austerities of the mind.","Purport
To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one‚Äôs nature is to become K·πõ·π£·πáa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind‚Äôs becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the
PurƒÅ·πáas
and the
MahƒÅbhƒÅrata.
One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealings and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities."

It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme ‚Äì

the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal ‚Äì they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words,
o·πÅ tat sat,
particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word
o·πÅ
is always found.
One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charity, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the mode of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality.

ChƒÅndogya Upani·π£ad
6.8.7) indicates the second goal. And
sad eva saumya
(
ChƒÅndogya Upani·π£ad
6.2.1) indicates the third goal. Combined they become
o·πÅ tat sat.
Formerly when BrahmƒÅ, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he indicated by these three words the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the same principle has always been followed by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance.
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for
o·πÅ tat sat,
or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way."

Anything done as sacrifice, charity or penance without faith in the Supreme, O son of P·πõthƒÅ, is impermanent. It is called asat and is useless both in this life and the next.","Purport
Anything done without the transcendental objective ‚Äì whether it be sacrifice, charity or penance ‚Äì is useless. Therefore in this verse it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of K·πõ·π£·πáa. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.
In the conditional state, people are attracted to worshiping demigods, ghosts, or Yak·π£as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended in this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should therefore take to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of the Divisions of Faith."

Actually the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service:
yoginƒÅm api sarve·π£ƒÅm¬†‚Ä¶
‚ÄúOf all
yogƒ´s
or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.‚Äù In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words
o·πÅ tat sat,
which indicate Vi·π£·πáu, the Supreme Person. The third part of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past
ƒÅcƒÅryas
and the
Brahma-s≈´tra,
the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra,
but actually the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra,
and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every
Veda,
devotional service is the objective. That is explained in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
.
As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
namely renunciation (
tyƒÅga
) and the renounced order of life (
sannyƒÅsa
). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.
Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord ‚Äì H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa and Ke≈õi-ni·π£≈´dana ‚Äì are significant. H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa is K·πõ·π£·πáa, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses K·πõ·π£·πáa as Ke≈õi-ni·π£≈´dana. Ke≈õƒ´ was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting K·πõ·π£·πáa to kill the demon of doubt."

The performance of activities for results has to be given up. This is the instruction of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
But activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up. This will be made clear in the next verses. In the Vedic literature there are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose. There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped. However, sacrifice for the purification of one‚Äôs heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up."

There are many activities in the Vedic literature which are subjects of contention. For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain that animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself."

Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up; they must be performed. Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.","Purport
The
yogƒ´s
should perform acts for the advancement of human society. There are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life. The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It is called
vivƒÅha-yaj√±a.
Should a
sannyƒÅsƒ´,
who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up.
VivƒÅha-yaj√±a,
the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind so that it may become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, this
vivƒÅha-yaj√±a
should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life.
SannyƒÅsƒ´s
should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life."

All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of P·πõthƒÅ. That is My final opinion.","Purport
Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one‚Äôs existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness must be encouraged. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord."

Work for material satisfaction must be given up, but activities which promote one to spiritual activity, like cooking for the Supreme Lord and offering the food to the Lord and then accepting the food, are recommended. It is said that a person in the renounced order of life should not cook for himself. Cooking for oneself is prohibited, but cooking for the Supreme Lord is not prohibited. Similarly, a
sannyƒÅsƒ´
may perform a marriage ceremony to help his disciple in the advancement of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. If one renounces such activities, it is to be understood that he is acting in the mode of darkness."

If by working one can engage his money in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, or if by rising early in the morning one can advance his transcendental K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, one should not desist out of fear or because such activities are considered troublesome. Such renunciation is in the mode of passion. The result of passionate work is always miserable. If a person renounces work in that spirit, he never gets the result of renunciation."

O Arjuna, when one performs his prescribed duty only because it ought to be done, and renounces all material association and all attachment to the fruit, his renunciation is said to be in the mode of goodness.","Purport
Prescribed duties must be performed with this mentality. One should act without attachment for the result; he should be disassociated from the modes of work. A man working in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness in a factory does not associate himself with the work of the factory, nor with the workers of the factory. He simply works for K·πõ·π£·πáa.

that one can never give up work at any time. Therefore he who works for K·πõ·π£·πáa and does not enjoy the fruitive results, who offers everything to K·πõ·π£·πáa, is actually a renouncer. There are many members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness who work very hard in their office or in the factory or some other place, and whatever they earn they give to the Society. Such highly elevated souls are actually
sannyƒÅsƒ´s
and are situated in the renounced order of life. It is clearly outlined here how to renounce the fruits of work and for what purpose fruits should be renounced."

O mighty-armed Arjuna, according to the VedƒÅnta there are five causes for the accomplishment of all action. Now learn of these from Me.","Purport
A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing
VedƒÅnta
philosophy to show how this is possible. He says that there are five causes for all activities, and for success in all activity one should consider these five causes.
SƒÅ·πÖkhya
means the stock of knowledge, and
VedƒÅnta
is the final stock of knowledge accepted by all leading
ƒÅcƒÅryas.
Even ≈öa·πÖkara accepts
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
as such. Therefore such authority should be consulted.
The ultimate control is invested in the Supersoul. As it is stated in the
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, sarvasya cƒÅha·πÅ h·πõdi sannivi·π£·π≠a·∏•.

The place of action [the body], the performer, the various senses, the many different kinds of endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul ‚Äì these are the five factors of action.","Purport
The word
adhi·π£·π≠hƒÅnam
refers to the body. The soul within the body is acting to bring about the results of activity and is therefore known as
kartƒÅ,
‚Äúthe doer.‚Äù That the soul is the knower and the doer is stated in the
≈õruti. E·π£a hi dra·π£·π≠ƒÅ sra·π£·π≠ƒÅ

(2.3.18) and
kartƒÅ ≈õƒÅstrƒÅrthavattvƒÅt
(2.3.33). The instruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various ways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one‚Äôs activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the supercause. Under these circumstances, he who is acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in complete K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions. Everything is dependent on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

A foolish person cannot understand that the Supersoul is sitting as a friend within and conducting his actions. Although the material causes are the place, the worker, the endeavor and the senses, the final cause is the Supreme, the Personality of Godhead.

One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled, though he kills men in this world, does not kill. Nor is he bound by his actions.","Purport
In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from false ego. Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not consider the supreme sanction within and without. If one does not know that a supersanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instruments of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner is perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. Anyone who is acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected by the reaction of such killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then he is certainly judged by a court of law."

There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower. The instruments of work, the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work. Any work done by any human being has these elements. Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called impetus. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses, including the mind, which is the center of all the senses.

In the Fourteenth Chapter the three divisions of the modes of material nature were elaborately described. In that chapter it was said that the mode of goodness is illuminating, the mode of passion materialistic, and the mode of ignorance conducive to laziness and indolence. All the modes of material nature are binding; they are not sources of liberation. Even in the mode of goodness one is conditioned. In the Seventeenth Chapter, the different types of worship by different types of men in different modes of material nature were described.

A person who sees one spirit soul in every living being, whether a demigod, human being, animal, bird, beast, aquatic or plant, possesses knowledge in the mode of goodness. In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work. As described in the Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to the superior nature of the Supreme Lord. Thus to see that one superior nature, that living force, in every body is to see in the mode of goodness. That living energy is imperishable, although the bodies are perishable. Differences are perceived in terms of the body; because there are many forms of material existence in conditional life, the living force appears to be divided.

The concept that the material body is the living entity and that with the destruction of the body the consciousness is also destroyed is called knowledge in the mode of passion. According to that knowledge, bodies differ from one another because of the development of different types of consciousness, otherwise there is no separate soul which manifests consciousness. The body is itself the soul, and there is no separate soul beyond the body. According to such knowledge, consciousness is temporary. Or else there are no individual souls, but there is an all-pervading soul, which is full of knowledge, and this body is a manifestation of temporary ignorance.

One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or scriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body. He is not concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture. For him God is money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands. Such knowledge has no connection with the Absolute Truth. It is more or less like the knowledge of the ordinary animals: the knowledge of eating, sleeping, defending and mating. Such knowledge is described here as the product of the mode of darkness. In other words, knowledge concerning the spirit soul beyond this body is called knowledge in the mode of goodness, knowledge producing many theories and doctrines by dint of mundane logic and mental speculation is the product of the mode of passion, and knowledge concerned only with keeping the body comfortable is said to be in the mode of ignorance."

By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, a man can attain perfection through performing his own work.","Purport
As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all living beings are fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. Thus the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all living entities. This is confirmed in the
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
‚Äì
janmƒÅdy asya yata·∏•.
The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And as stated in the Seventh Chapter of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vai·π£·πáava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as ParamƒÅtmƒÅ is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. That is recommended in this verse.
Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by H·πõ·π£ƒ´ke≈õa, the master of the senses. And by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa, should be worshiped. If one thinks always in this way, in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(12.7),
te·π£ƒÅm aha·πÅ samuddhartƒÅ.
The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord he will achieve the highest perfection."

It is better to engage in one‚Äôs own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another‚Äôs occupation and perform it perfectly. Duties prescribed according to one‚Äôs nature are never affected by sinful reactions.","Purport
One‚Äôs occupational duty is prescribed in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a
brƒÅhma·πáa, k·π£atriya, vai≈õya
and
≈õ≈´dra
are prescribed according to their particular modes of nature. One should not imitate another‚Äôs duty. A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by
≈õ≈´dras
should not artificially claim to be a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
although he may have been born into a
brƒÅhma·πáa
family. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of a
brƒÅhma·πáa
is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a
brƒÅhma·πáa.
For a
k·π£atriya,
or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a
k·π£atriya
has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a
k·π£atriya
has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a
k·π£atriya
is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a
brƒÅhma·πáa.
One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord. For example, Arjuna was a
k·π£atriya.
He was hesitating to fight the other party. But if such fighting is performed for the sake of K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation. In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit. If he does not do so, there can be no profit. Sometimes a merchant says, ‚ÄúOh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit,‚Äù but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist. Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit. But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a
brƒÅhma·πáa.
That is not recommended. Whether one is a
k·π£atriya,
a
vai≈õya,
or a
≈õ≈´dra
doesn‚Äôt matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even
brƒÅhma·πáas,
who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies. Similarly, if a
k·π£atriya
engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred. In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of Yaj√±a, or for Vi·π£·πáu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage. The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord."

Every endeavor is covered by some fault, just as fire is covered by smoke. Therefore one should not give up the work born of his nature, O son of Kuntƒ´, even if such work is full of fault.","Purport
In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature. Even if one is a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary. Similarly, a
k·π£atriya,
however pious he may be, has to fight enemies. He cannot avoid it. Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is a
≈õ≈´dra
serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done. Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.
A very nice example is given herein. Although fire is pure, still there is smoke. Yet smoke does not make the fire impure. Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements. If one prefers to give up the work of a
k·π£atriya
and take up the occupation of a
brƒÅhma·πáa,
he is not assured that in the occupation of a
brƒÅhma·πáa
there are no unpleasant duties. One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature. This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection. When in wintertime one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions. Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements. Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. That is the perfectional point. When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified. When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization."

One who is self-controlled and unattached and who disregards all material enjoyments can obtain, by practice of renunciation, the highest perfect stage of freedom from reaction.","Purport
Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore think that he has no right to enjoy the results of his work. Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actually K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The person acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is really a
sannyƒÅsƒ´,
one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. A
sannyƒÅsƒ´
is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called
yogƒÅr≈´·∏çha,
or the perfectional stage of
yoga.

The Lord describes for Arjuna how one can achieve the highest perfectional stage simply by being engaged in his occupational duty, performing that duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One attains the supreme stage of Brahman simply by renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. That is the process of self-realization. The actual perfection of knowledge is in attaining pure K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness; that is described in the following verses."

One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He never laments or desires to have anything. He is equally disposed toward every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.","Purport
To the impersonalist, achieving the
brahma-bh≈´ta
stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word. But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further, to become engaged in pure devotional service. This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called
brahma-bh≈´ta,
oneness with the Absolute. Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him. In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.
In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery. The devotee in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness has nothing for which to lament or desire. Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God‚Äôs service, in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, becomes also full in himself. He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water. Because a pure devotee has no thought other than K·πõ·π£·πáa, he is naturally always joyful. He does not lament for any material loss or aspire for gain, because he is full in the service of the Lord. He has no desire for material enjoyment, because he knows that every living entity is a fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant. He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances. For him stone and gold are of equal value. This is the
brahma-bh≈´ta
stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee. In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one‚Äôs individuality becomes hellish, the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like serpents whose poison teeth are broken. As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled. The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaiku·πá·π≠ha, or the spiritual sky. The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee. Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age."

One can understand Me as I am, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of Me by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.","Purport
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, and His plenary portions cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees. If anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee. Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden. As already stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
(7.25)
,
nƒÅha·πÅ prakƒÅ≈õa·∏• sarvasya:
He is not revealed to everyone. No one can understand God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation. Only one who is actually engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness and devotional service can understand what K·πõ·π£·πáa is. University degrees are not helpful.
One who is fully conversant with the K·πõ·π£·πáa science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity. Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service. Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation. Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One should not mistakenly think that the word
vi≈õate,
‚Äúenters into Me,‚Äù supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman. No.
Vi≈õate
means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in one‚Äôs individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him. For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree. Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging. This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean. We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep. Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.
Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth. As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand. The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.
After attainment of the
brahma-bh≈´ta
stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one‚Äôs hearing about the Lord. When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the
brahma-bh≈´ta
stage develops, and material contamination ‚Äì greediness and lust for sense enjoyment ‚Äì disappears. As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination. In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord. This is the statement of
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam
also. After liberation the process of
bhakti,
or transcendental service, continues. The
VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra
(4.1.12) confirms this:
ƒÅ-prƒÅya·πáƒÅt tatrƒÅpi hi d·πõ·π£·π≠am.
This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues. In the
≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,
real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position. The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is a part-and-parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore his constitutional position is to serve. After liberation, this service is never stopped. Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life."

There is no time limitation for a pure devotee. He is always, twenty-four hours a day, one hundred percent engaged in activities under the direction of the Supreme Lord. To a devotee who is thus engaged in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness the Lord is very, very kind. In spite of all difficulties, he is eventually placed in the transcendental abode, or K·πõ·π£·πáaloka. He is guaranteed entrance there; there is no doubt about it. In that supreme abode, there is no change; everything is eternal, imperishable and full of knowledge."

When one acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he does not act as the master of the world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master is unaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of K·πõ·π£·πáa but when K·πõ·π£·πáa is not present how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of K·πõ·π£·πáa in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of K·πõ·π£·πáa, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit word
mat-para·∏•
is very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness just to satisfy K·πõ·π£·πáa. And while working in that way, one should think of K·πõ·π£·πáa only: ‚ÄúI have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by K·πõ·π£·πáa.‚Äù While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is perfect K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. One should act according to the order of K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is a very important point. That order of K·πõ·π£·πáa comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master‚Äôs order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then one‚Äôs perfection of life in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is guaranteed."

If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, not hearing Me, you will be lost.","Purport
A person in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is not unduly anxious about executing the duties of his existence. The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety. For one who acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa becomes the most intimate friend. He always looks after His friend‚Äôs comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under strict material laws. But as soon as he acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who is not active in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by K·πõ·π£·πáa from within and confirmed by the spiritual master."

Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the

Therefore his natural duty was to fight. But due to false ego he was fearing that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends he would incur sinful reactions. Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work. He forgot that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight. That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul. The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master, who is the representative of God. One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead ‚Äì that will keep one safe under all circumstances."

Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined to his limited discretion. Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa instructed that the individual is not all in all. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, K·πõ·π£·πáa, as the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being. After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The living entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under the Lord‚Äôs control. Therefore one‚Äôs duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse."

A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone‚Äôs heart, and that will relieve him from all kinds of miseries of this material existence. By such surrender, not only will one be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach the Supreme God. The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature (

it is stated,

the Lord is seated in everyone‚Äôs heart. So this recommendation that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. K·πõ·π£·πáa has already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme. He was accepted in the Tenth Chapter as
para·πÅ brahma para·πÅ dhƒÅma.
Arjuna has accepted K·πõ·π£·πáa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only because of his personal experience but also because of the evidence of great authorities like NƒÅrada, Asita, Devala and VyƒÅsa."

The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of

One who is in the

Here the words

‚Äì ‚ÄúAs you like, you may act‚Äù ‚Äì indicate that God does not interfere with the little independence of the living entity. In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition. The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated within his heart. By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul. That will help one become situated constantly in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life. Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight. Surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities. It is not for the interest of the Supreme. Before surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way to accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

‚ÄúJust always think of Me.‚Äù The same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of

Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend.","Purport
The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa and always think of Him and act for Him. One should not become an official meditator. Life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of K·πõ·π£·πáa. One should always act in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with K·πõ·π£·πáa. He should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of K·πõ·π£·πáa. And the Lord‚Äôs promise is that anyone who is in such pure K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness will certainly return to the abode of K·πõ·π£·πáa, where he will be engaged in the association of K·πõ·π£·πáa face to face. This most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Everyone who follows the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to K·πõ·π£·πáa and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.
These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon K·πõ·π£·πáa ‚Äì the very form with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair. There are descriptions of K·πõ·π£·πáa found in the
Brahma-sa·πÅhitƒÅ
and other literatures. One should fix his mind on this original form of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. One should not even divert his attention to other forms of the Lord. The Lord has multiforms as Vi·π£·πáu, NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, RƒÅma, VarƒÅha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna. Concentration of the mind on the form of K·πõ·π£·πáa constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs."

Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.","Purport
The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge and processes of religion ‚Äì knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc. He has described in so many ways different types of religion. Now, in summarizing
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to K·πõ·π£·πáa. That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.
In the Seventh Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process. To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to ≈örƒ´ K·πõ·π£·πáa he is automatically freed. There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions. One should unhesitatingly accept K·πõ·π£·πáa as the supreme savior of all living entities. With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.
The process of surrender to K·πõ·π£·πáa is described in the
Hari-bhakti-vilƒÅsa
(11.676):
ƒÅnuk≈´lyasya sa·πÖkalpa·∏•
prƒÅtik≈´lyasya varjanam

·π£a·∏ç-vidhƒÅ ≈õara·πáƒÅgati·∏•
According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord. One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, all his activities are in vain. Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness should be avoided. One should be confident that in all circumstances K·πõ·π£·πáa will protect him from all difficulties. There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together. K·πõ·π£·πáa will see to that. One should always think himself helpless and should consider K·πõ·π£·πáa the only basis for his progress in life. As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature. There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic
yoga
system, etc., but one who surrenders unto K·πõ·π£·πáa does not have to execute so many methods. That simple surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa will save him from unnecessarily wasting time. One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reactions.
One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of K·πõ·π£·πáa. His name is K·πõ·π£·πáa because He is all-attractive. One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of K·πõ·π£·πáa is fortunate. There are different kinds of transcendentalists ‚Äì some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist. In other words, devotional service to K·πõ·π£·πáa, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. Karma-yogƒ´s,
empiric philosophers, mystics and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all. The particular words used here,
mƒÅ ≈õuca·∏•,
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fear, don‚Äôt hesitate, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù are very significant. One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa, but such worry is useless."

as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead."

And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reactions and attains to the auspicious planets where the pious dwell.","Purport
In the sixty-seventh verse of this chapter, the Lord explicitly forbade the
Gƒ´tƒÅ‚Äôs
being spoken to those who are envious of the Lord. In other words,
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is for the devotees only. But it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class not all the students are expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although not everyone is a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious of K·πõ·π£·πáa. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.
Generally those who are free from sinful reactions, those who are righteous, very easily take to K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness. The word
pu·πáya-karma·πáƒÅm
is very significant here. This refers to the performance of great sacrifices, like the
a≈õvamedha-yaj√±a,
mentioned in the Vedic literature. Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva MahƒÅrƒÅja is presiding. He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet, which is called the polestar."

from a bona fide spiritual master like K·πõ·π£·πáa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled.
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord. He is meant for self-discipline. ≈örƒ´ Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity‚Äôs constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusory
mƒÅyƒÅ
or the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare of
mƒÅyƒÅ
to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.
The word
moha
is very important in this verse.
Moha
refers to that which is opposed to knowledge. Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally a servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not a servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature. That is his illusion. This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee. When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness.
K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is acting according to K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs order. A conditioned soul, illusioned by the external energy of matter, does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything. Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee. He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities. He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee. One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of
mƒÅyƒÅ.
Arjuna, however, after hearing
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion. He could understand that K·πõ·π£·πáa was not only his friend but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he understood K·πõ·π£·πáa factually. So to study
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa factually. When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to K·πõ·π£·πáa. When Arjuna understood that it was K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs desire. He again took up his weapons ‚Äì his arrows and bow ‚Äì to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

In the beginning of

Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra inquired from his secretary Sa√±jaya, ‚ÄúWhat happened on the Battlefield of Kuruk·π£etra?‚Äù The entire study was related to the heart of Sa√±jaya by the grace of his spiritual master, VyƒÅsa. He thus explained the theme of the battlefield. The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls had never taken place before and would not take place again. It was wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord. If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa, then our life will be happy and successful. Sa√±jaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra. Now it is concluded that wherever there is K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna, there is victory."

By the mercy of VyƒÅsa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, K·πõ·π£·πáa, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.","Purport
VyƒÅsa was the spiritual master of Sa√±jaya, and Sa√±jaya admits that it was by VyƒÅsa‚Äôs mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This means that one has to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master. The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is still direct. This is the mystery of the disciplic succession. When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
directly, as Arjuna heard it. There are many mystics and
yogƒ´s
all over the world, but K·πõ·π£·πáa is the master of all
yoga
systems. K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs instruction is explicitly stated in
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
‚Äì surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa. One who does so is the topmost
yogƒ´.
This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.
YoginƒÅm api sarve·π£ƒÅm.
NƒÅrada is the direct disciple of K·πõ·π£·πáa and the spiritual master of VyƒÅsa. Therefore VyƒÅsa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sa√±jaya is the direct disciple of VyƒÅsa. Therefore by the grace of VyƒÅsa, Sa√±jaya‚Äôs senses were purified, and he could see and hear K·πõ·π£·πáa directly. One who directly hears K·πõ·π£·πáa can understand this confidential knowledge. If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear K·πõ·π£·πáa; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is concerned.
In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,
all the
yoga
systems ‚Äì
karma-yoga, j√±ƒÅna-yoga
and
bhakti-yoga
‚Äì are explained. K·πõ·π£·πáa is the master of all such mysticism. It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand K·πõ·π£·πáa directly, so, by the grace of VyƒÅsa, Sa√±jaya was also able to hear K·πõ·π£·πáa directly. Actually there is no difference between hearing directly from K·πõ·π£·πáa and hearing directly from K·πõ·π£·πáa via a bona fide spiritual master like VyƒÅsa. The spiritual master is the representative of VyƒÅsadeva also. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master the disciples conduct the ceremony called VyƒÅsa-p≈´jƒÅ."

Wherever there is K·πõ·π£·πáa, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion.","Purport
The
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
began with an inquiry of Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra‚Äôs. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhƒ´·π£ma, Dro·πáa and Kar·πáa. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield, Sa√±jaya told the King, ‚ÄúYou are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune.‚Äù He directly confirmed that Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra could not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because K·πõ·π£·πáa was there. K·πõ·π£·πáa‚Äôs acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence. K·πõ·π£·πáa is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, for K·πõ·π£·πáa is also the master of renunciation.
The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhi·π£·π≠hira. Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhi·π£·π≠hira. Because K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhi·π£·π≠hira, Yudhi·π£·π≠hira‚Äôs victory was certain. The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sa√±jaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhi·π£·π≠hira. It is also predicted here that Yudhi·π£·π≠hira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because not only was he righteous and pious but he was also a strict moralist. He never spoke a lie during his life.
There are many less intelligent persons who take
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
to be a discussion of topics between two friends on a battlefield. But such a book cannot be scripture. Some may protest that K·πõ·π£·πáa incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated:
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is the supreme instruction in morality. The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse:
man-manƒÅ bhava mad-bhakta·∏•.
One must become a devotee of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa (
sarva-dharmƒÅn parityajya mƒÅm eka·πÅ ≈õara·πáa·πÅ vraja
). The instructions of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality. All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the
Gƒ´tƒÅ
is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa. This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.
From
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa is the highest perfection. This is the essence of the teachings of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.
The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge. But although the rituals of religion are confidential, meditation and cultivation of knowledge are still more confidential. And surrender unto K·πõ·π£·πáa in devotional service in full K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness is the most confidential instruction. That is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.
Another feature of
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features ‚Äì impersonal Brahman, localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of K·πõ·π£·πáa. If one understands K·πõ·π£·πáa, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding. K·πõ·π£·πáa is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency. The living entities are manifested of His energy and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated. Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions. The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy. This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.
In
Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities. All is dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa. All conceptions of the Absolute Truth ‚Äì impersonal Brahman, localized ParamƒÅtmƒÅ and any other transcendental conception ‚Äì exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme. But the Supreme is always different from everything. Lord Caitanya‚Äôs philosophy is that of ‚Äúinconceivable oneness and difference.‚Äù This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.
The living entity in his original position is pure spirit. He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit. Thus Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa may be compared to the sun, and the living entities to sunshine. Because the living entities are the marginal energy of K·πõ·π£·πáa, they have a tendency to be in contact either with the material energy or with the spiritual energy. In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence. By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of K·πõ·π£·πáa. Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighteenth Chapter of the
≈örƒ´mad Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ
in the matter of its Conclusion ‚Äì the Perfection of Renunciation."
